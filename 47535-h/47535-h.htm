<p class="cap pd30"><span class="upper">&ldquo;In</span> an old abbey town, down in
this part of the country, a
long, long while ago&mdash;so long,
that the story must be a true
one, because our great-grandfathers
implicitly believed it&mdash;there
officiated as sexton
and grave-digger in the churchyard, one Gabriel Grub. It by
no means follows that because a man is a sexton, and constantly
surrounded by the emblems of mortality, therefore he should be
a morose and melancholy man; your undertakers are the merriest
fellows in the world; and I once had the honour of being on intimate
terms with a mute, who in private life, and off duty, was as comical
and jocose a little fellow as ever chirped out a devil-may-care song,
without a hitch in his memory, or drained off the contents of a
good stiff glass without stopping for breath. But, notwithstanding
these precedents to the contrary, Gabriel Grub was an ill-conditioned,
cross-grained, surly fellow&mdash;a morose and lonely man,
who consorted with nobody but himself, and an old wicker bottle
which fitted into his large deep waistcoat pocket&mdash;and who eyed
each merry face, as it passed him by, with such a deep scowl of
malice and ill-humour, as it was difficult to meet, without feeling
something the worse for.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little before twilight, one Christmas Eve, Gabriel shouldered
his spade, lighted his lantern, and betook himself towards the old
churchyard; for he had got a grave to finish by next morning, and,
feeling very low, he thought it might raise his spirits, perhaps, if he
went on with his work at once. As he went his way, up the ancient
street, he saw the cheerful light of blazing fires gleam through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the old casements, and heard the loud laugh and the cheerful shouts
of those who were assembled around them; he marked the bustling
preparations for next day&rsquo;s cheer, and smelt the numerous savoury
odours consequent thereupon, as they steamed up from the kitchen
windows in clouds. All this was gall and wormwood to the heart
of Gabriel Grub: and when groups of children bounded out of the
houses, tripped across the road, and were met, before they could
knock at the opposite door, by half a dozen curly-headed little
rascals who crowded round them as they flocked up-stairs to spend
the evening in their Christmas games, Gabriel smiled grimly, and
clutched the handle of his spade with a firmer grasp, as he thought
of measles, scarlet-fever, thrush, hooping-cough, and a good many
other sources of consolation besides.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In this happy frame of mind, Gabriel strode along: returning
a short, sullen growl to the good-humoured greetings of such of
his neighbours as now and then passed him: until he turned into
the dark lane which led to the churchyard. Now, Gabriel had
been looking forward to reaching the dark lane, because it was,
generally speaking, a nice, gloomy, mournful place, into which the
townspeople did not much care to go, except in broad daylight,
and when the sun was shining; consequently, he was not a little
indignant to hear a young urchin roaring out some jolly song about
a merry Christmas, in this very sanctuary, which had been called
Coffin Lane ever since the days of the old abbey, and the time of
the shaven-headed monks. As Gabriel walked on, and the voice
drew nearer, he found it proceeded from a small boy, who was
hurrying along, to join one of the little parties in the old street,
and who, partly to keep himself company, and partly to prepare
himself for the occasion, was shouting out the song at the highest
pitch of his lungs. So Gabriel waited until the boy came up, and
then dodged him into a corner, and rapped him over the head with
his lantern five or six times, to teach him to modulate his voice.
And as the boy hurried away with his hand to his head, singing
quite a different sort of tune, Gabriel Grub chuckled very heartily
to himself, and entered the churchyard: locking the gate behind
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He took off his coat, put down his lantern, and getting into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
the unfinished grave, worked at it for an hour or so, with right
good will. But the earth was hardened with the frost, and it was
no very easy matter to break it up, and shovel it out; and although
there was a moon, it was a very young one, and shed little light
upon the grave, which was in the shadow of the church. At any
other time, these obstacles would have made Gabriel Grub very
moody and miserable, but he was so well pleased with having
stopped the small boy&rsquo;s singing, that he took little heed of the
scanty progress he had made, and looked down into the grave,
when he had finished work for the night, with grim satisfaction:
murmuring as he gathered up his things:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0c">&lsquo;Brave lodgings for one, brave lodgings for one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A few feet of cold earth, when life is done;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A stone at the head, a stone at the feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A rich, juicy meal for the worms to eat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rank grass over head, and damp clay around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brave lodgings for one, these, in holy ground!&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ho! ho!&rsquo; laughed Gabriel Grub, as he sat himself down on
a flat tombstone which was a favourite resting-place of his; and
drew forth his wicker bottle. &lsquo;A coffin at Christmas! A Christmas
Box. Ho! ho! ho!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ho! ho! ho!&rsquo; repeated a voice which sounded close behind him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gabriel paused, in some alarm, in the act of raising the wicker
bottle to his lips: and looked round. The bottom of the oldest
grave about him was not more still and quiet than the churchyard
in the pale moonlight. The cold hoar-frost glistened on the tombstones,
and sparkled like rows of gems, among the stone carvings
of the old church. The snow lay hard and crisp upon the ground;
and spread over the thickly-strewn mounds of earth, so white and
smooth a cover, that it seemed as if corpses lay there, hidden only
by their winding-sheets. Not the faintest rustle broke the profound
tranquillity of the solemn scene. Sound itself appeared to be frozen
up, all was so cold and still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It was the echoes,&rsquo; said Gabriel Grub, raising the bottle to
his lips again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It was <em>not</em>,&rsquo; said a deep voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Gabriel started up, and stood rooted to the spot with astonishment
and terror; for his eyes rested on a form that made his blood
run cold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seated on an upright tombstone, close to him, was a strange
unearthly figure, whom Gabriel felt at once, was no being of this
world. His long fantastic legs, which might have reached the
ground, were cocked up, and crossed after a quaint, fantastic
fashion; his sinewy arms were bare; and his hands rested on his
knees. On his short round body, he wore a close covering, ornamented
with small slashes; a short cloak dangled at his back; the
collar was cut into curious peaks, which served the goblin in lieu
of ruff or neckerchief; and his shoes curled up at his toes into long
points. On his head he wore a broad-brimmed sugar-loaf hat,
garnished with a single feather. The hat was covered with the
white frost; and the goblin looked as if he had sat on the same
tombstone, very comfortably, for two or three hundred years.
He was sitting perfectly still; his tongue was put out, as if in
derision; and he was grinning at Gabriel Grub with such a grin
as only a goblin could call up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It was <em>not</em> the echoes,&rsquo; said the goblin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gabriel Grub was paralysed, and could make no reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What do you do here on Christmas Eve?&rsquo; said the goblin,
sternly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I came to dig a grave, sir,&rsquo; stammered Gabriel Grub.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What man wanders among graves and churchyards on such
a night as this?&rsquo; cried the goblin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Gabriel Grub! Gabriel Grub!&rsquo; screamed a wild chorus of
voices that seemed to fill the churchyard. Gabriel looked fearfully
round&mdash;nothing was to be seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What have you got in that bottle?&rsquo; said the goblin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hollands, sir,&rsquo; replied the sexton, trembling more than ever;
for he had bought it of the smugglers, and he thought that perhaps
his questioner might be in the excise department of the goblins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who drinks Hollands alone, and in the churchyard, on such
a night as this?&rsquo; said the goblin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Gabriel Grub! Gabriel Grub!&rsquo; exclaimed the wild voices
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The goblin leered maliciously at the terrified sexton, and then
raising his voice exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And who, then, is our fair and lawful prize?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To this inquiry the invisible chorus replied, in a strain that
sounded like the voices of many choristers singing to the mighty
swell of the old church organ&mdash;a strain that seemed borne to the
sexton&rsquo;s ears upon a wild wind, and to die away as it passed onward;
but the burden of the reply was still the same, &lsquo;Gabriel Grub!
Gabriel Grub!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The goblin grinned a broader grin than before, as he said,
&lsquo;Well, Gabriel, what do you say to this?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sexton gasped for breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What do you think of this, Gabriel?&rsquo; said the goblin, kicking
up his feet in the air on either side of the tombstone, and looking
at the turned-up points with as much complacency as if he had
been contemplating the most fashionable pair of Wellingtons in all
Bond Street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;very curious, sir,&rsquo; replied the sexton, half dead
with fright; &lsquo;very curious, and very pretty, but I think I&rsquo;ll go
back and finish my work, sir, if you please.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Work!&rsquo; said the goblin, &lsquo;what work?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The grave, sir; making the grave,&rsquo; stammered the sexton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, the grave, eh?&rsquo; said the goblin; &lsquo;who makes graves at
a time when all other men are merry, and takes a pleasure in it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again the mysterious voices replied, &lsquo;Gabriel Grub!
Gabriel Grub!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid my friends want you, Gabriel,&rsquo; said the goblin,
thrusting his tongue further into his cheek than ever&mdash;and a most
astonishing tongue it was&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid my friends want you,
Gabriel,&rsquo; said the goblin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Under favour, sir,&rsquo; replied the horror-stricken sexton, &lsquo;I
don&rsquo;t think they can, sir; they don&rsquo;t know me, sir; I don&rsquo;t think
the gentlemen have ever seen me, sir.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh yes, they have,&rsquo; replied the goblin; &lsquo;we know the man
with the sulky face and grim scowl, that came down the street
to-night, throwing his evil looks at the children, and grasping his
burying-spade the tighter. We know the man who struck the boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
in the envious malice of his heart, because the boy could be merry,
and he could not. We know him, we know him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here the goblin gave a loud shrill laugh, which the echoes
returned twenty-fold: and throwing his legs up in the air, stood
upon his head, or rather upon the very point of his sugar-loaf hat,
on the narrow edge of the tombstone: whence he threw a somerset
with extraordinary agility, right to the sexton&rsquo;s feet, at which he
planted himself in the attitude in which tailors generally sit upon
the shop-board.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;am afraid I must leave you, sir,&rsquo; said the sexton, making
an effort to move.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Leave us!&rsquo; said the goblin, &lsquo;Gabriel Grub going to leave
us. Ho! ho! ho!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the goblin laughed, the sexton observed, for one instant, a
brilliant illumination within the windows of the church, as if the
whole building were lighted up; it disappeared, the organ pealed
forth a lively air, and whole troops of goblins, the very counterpart
of the first one, poured into the churchyard, and began playing at
leap-frog with the tombstones: never stopping for an instant to
take breath, but &lsquo;overing&rsquo; the highest among them, one after the
other, with the utmost marvellous dexterity. The first goblin was
a most astonishing leaper, and none of the others could come near
him; even in the extremity of his terror the sexton could not help
observing, that while his friends were content to leap over the
common-sized gravestones, the first one took the family vaults,
iron railings and all, with as much ease as if they had been so many
street posts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At last the game reached to a most exciting pitch; the organ
played quicker and quicker; and the goblins leaped faster and
faster: coiling themselves up, rolling head over heels upon the
ground, and bounding over the tombstones like footballs. The
sexton&rsquo;s brain whirled round with the rapidity of the motion he
beheld, and his legs reeled beneath him, as the spirits flew before
his eyes: when the goblin king, suddenly darting towards him, laid
his hand upon his collar, and sank with him through the earth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When Gabriel Grub had had time to fetch his breath, which
the rapidity of his descent had for the moment taken away, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
found himself in what appeared to be a huge cavern, surrounded
on all sides by crowds of goblins, ugly and grim; in the centre of
the room, on an elevated seat, was stationed his friend of the churchyard;
and close beside him stood Gabriel Grub himself, without
power of motion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cold to-night,&rsquo; said the king of the goblins, &lsquo;very cold. A
glass of something warm, here!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At this command, half a dozen officious goblins, with a perpetual
smile upon their faces, whom Gabriel Grub imagined to
be courtiers, on that account, hastily disappeared, and presently
returned with a goblet of liquid fire, which they presented to the
king.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; cried the goblin, whose cheeks and throat were transparent,
as he tossed down the flame, &lsquo;this warms one, indeed!
Bring a bumper of the same for Mr. Grub.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was in vain for the unfortunate sexton to protest that he
was not in the habit of taking anything warm at night; one of the
goblins held him while another poured the blazing liquid down his
throat; the whole assembly screeched with laughter as he coughed
and choked, and wiped away the tears which gushed plentifully
from his eyes, after swallowing the burning draught.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And now,&rsquo; said the king, fantastically poking the taper corner
of his sugar-loaf hat into the sexton&rsquo;s eye, and thereby occasioning
him the most exquisite pain: &lsquo;And now, show the man of misery
and gloom, a few of the pictures from our own great storehouse!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the goblin said this, a thick cloud which obscured the
remoter end of the cavern rolled gradually away, and disclosed,
apparently at a great distance, a small and scantily furnished, but
neat and clean apartment. A crowd of little children were gathered
round a bright fire, clinging to their mother&rsquo;s gown, and gambolling
around her chair. The mother occasionally rose, and drew aside
the window-curtain, as if to look for some expected object; a
frugal meal was ready spread upon the table; and an elbow chair
was placed near the fire. A knock was heard at the door: the
mother opened it, and the children crowded round her, and clapped
their hands for joy, as their father entered. He was wet and weary,
and shook the snow from his garments, as the children crowded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
round him, and seizing his cloak, hat, stick, and gloves, with busy
zeal, ran with them from the room. Then, as he sat down to his
meal before the fire, the children climbed about his knee, and the
mother sat by his side, and all seemed happiness and comfort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But a change came upon the view, almost imperceptibly. The
scene was altered to a small bed-room, where the fairest and
youngest child lay dying; the roses had fled from his cheek, and
the light from his eye; and even as the sexton looked upon him
with an interest he had never felt or known before, he died. His
young brothers and sisters crowded round his little bed, and seized
his tiny hand, so cold and heavy; but they shrunk back from its
touch, and looked with awe on his infant face; for calm and tranquil
as it was, and sleeping in rest and peace as the beautiful child
seemed to be, they saw that he was dead, and they knew that he
was an Angel looking down upon, and blessing them, from a bright
and happy Heaven.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again the light cloud passed across the picture, and again the
subject changed. The father and mother were old and helpless
now, and the number of those about them was diminished more
than half; but content and cheerfulness sat on every face, and
beamed in every eye, as they crowded round the fireside, and told
and listened to old stories of earlier and bygone days. Slowly and
peacefully the father sank into the grave, and, soon after, the sharer
of all his cares and troubles followed him to a place of rest. The
few, who yet survived them, knelt by their tomb, and watered the
green turf which covered it, with their tears; then rose, and turned
away: sadly and mournfully, but not with bitter cries, or despairing
lamentations, for they knew that they should one day meet again;
and once more they mixed with the busy world, and their content
and cheerfulness were restored. The cloud settled upon the
picture, and concealed it from the sexton&rsquo;s view.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What do you think of <em>that</em>?&rsquo; said the goblin, turning his
large face towards Gabriel Grub.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gabriel murmured out something about its being very pretty,
and looked somewhat ashamed, as the goblin bent his fiery eyes
upon him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<em>You</em> a miserable man!&rsquo; said the goblin, in a tone of excessive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
contempt. &lsquo;You!&rsquo; He appeared disposed to add more, but indignation
choked his utterance, so he lifted up one of his very
pliable legs, and flourishing it above his head a little, to insure his
aim, administered a good sound kick to Gabriel Grub; immediately
after which, all the goblins in waiting crowded round the wretched
sexton, and kicked him without mercy: according to the established
and invariable custom of courtiers upon earth, who kick whom
royalty kicks, and hug whom royalty hugs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Show him some more!&rsquo; said the king of the goblins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At these words, the cloud was dispelled, and a rich and
beautiful landscape was disclosed to view&mdash;there is just such
another to this day, within half a mile of the old abbey town.
The sun shone from out the clear blue sky, the water sparkled
beneath his rays, and the trees looked greener, and the flowers more
gay, beneath his cheering influence. The water rippled on, with a
pleasant sound; the trees rustled in the light wind that murmured
among their leaves; the birds sang upon the boughs; and the lark
carolled on high, her welcome to the morning. Yes, it was morning:
the bright, balmy morning of summer; the minutest leaf, the
smallest blade of grass, was instinct with life. The ant crept forth
to her daily toil, the butterfly fluttered and basked in the warm
rays of the sun; myriads of insects spread their transparent
wings, and revelled in their brief but happy existence. Man
walked forth, elated with the scene; and all was brightness and
splendour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<em>You</em> a miserable man!&rsquo; said the king of the goblins, in a more
contemptuous tone than before. And again the king of the goblins
gave his leg a flourish; again it descended on the shoulders of the
sexton; and again the attendant goblins imitated the example of
their chief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many a time the cloud went and came, and many a lesson it
taught to Gabriel Grub, who, although his shoulders smarted with
pain from the frequent applications of the goblins&rsquo; feet, looked on
with an interest that nothing could diminish. He saw that men
who worked hard, and earned their scanty bread with lives of
labour, were cheerful and happy; and that to the most ignorant,
the sweet face of nature was a never-failing source of cheerfulness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and joy. He saw those who had been delicately nurtured, and
tenderly brought up, cheerful under privations, and superior to
suffering, that would have crushed many of a rougher grain,
because they bore within their own bosoms the materials of happiness,
contentment, and peace. He saw that women, the tenderest
and most fragile of all God&rsquo;s creatures, were the oftenest superior
to sorrow, adversity, and distress; and he saw that it was because
they bore in their own hearts, an inexhaustible well-spring of
affection and devotion. Above all, he saw that men like himself,
who snarled at the mirth and cheerfulness of others, were the
foulest weeds on the fair face of the earth; and setting all the
good of the world against the evil, he came to the conclusion that
it was a very decent and respectable sort of world after all. No
sooner had he formed it, than the cloud which closed over the last
picture, seemed to settle on his senses, and lull him to repose. One
by one the goblins faded from his sight; and as the last one disappeared,
he sunk to sleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The day had broken when Gabriel Grub awoke, and found
himself lying, at full length, on the flat grave-stone in the churchyard
with the wicker bottle lying empty by his side, and his coat,
spade, and lantern, all well whitened by the last night&rsquo;s frost,
scattered on the ground. The stone on which he had first seen
the goblin seated, stood bolt upright before him, and the grave
at which he had worked, the night before, was not far off. At
first, he began to doubt the reality of his adventures, but the
acute pain in his shoulders when he attempted to rise, assured
him that the kicking of the goblins was certainly not ideal. He
was staggered again, by observing no traces of footsteps in the
snow, on which the goblins had played at leap-frog with the grave-stones,
but he speedily accounted for this circumstance when he
remembered that, being spirits, they would leave no visible impression
behind them. So, Gabriel Grub got on his feet as well as
he could, for the pain in his back; and brushing the frost off his
coat, put it on, and turned his face towards the town.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he was an altered man, and he could not bear the thought
of returning to a place where his repentance would be scoffed at,
and his reformation disbelieved. He hesitated for a few moments;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and then turned away to wander where he might, and seek his
bread elsewhere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lantern, the spade, and the wicker bottle, were found,
that day, in the churchyard. There were a great many speculations
about the sexton&rsquo;s fate, at first, but it was speedily determined that
he had been carried away by the goblins; and there were not
wanting some very credible witnesses who had distinctly seen him
whisked through the air on the back of a chestnut horse blind
of one eye, with the hind-quarters of a lion, and the tail of a bear.
At length all this was devoutly believed; and the new sexton used
to exhibit to the curious, for a trifling emolument, a good-sized
piece of the church weathercock which had been accidentally kicked
off by the aforesaid horse in his aërial flight, and picked up by
himself in the churchyard, a year or two afterwards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, these stories were somewhat disturbed by the
unlooked-for reappearance of Gabriel Grub himself, some ten years
afterwards, a ragged, contented, rheumatic old man. He told his
story to the clergyman, and also to the mayor; and in course of
time it began to be received as a matter of history, in which form
it has continued down to this very day. The believers in the
weathercock tale, having misplaced their confidence once, were not
easily prevailed upon to part with it again, so they looked as wise
as they could, shrugged their shoulders, touched their foreheads,
and murmured something about Gabriel Grub having drunk all
the Hollands, and then fallen asleep on the flat tombstone; and
they affected to explain what he supposed he had witnessed in the
goblins&rsquo; cavern, by saying that he had seen the world, and grown
wiser. But this opinion, which was by no means a popular one at
any time, gradually died off; and be the matter how it may, as
Gabriel Grub was afflicted with rheumatism to the end of his days,
this story has at least one moral, if it teach no better one&mdash;and
that is, that if a man turn sulky and drink by himself at Christmas
time, he may make up his mind to be not a bit the better for it:
let the spirits be never so good, or let them be even as many degrees
beyond proof, as those which Gabriel Grub saw in the goblins&rsquo;
cavern.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="cap pd05"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Well</span>, Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick as that favoured
servitor entered his bed-chamber with his warm
water, on the morning of Christmas Day, &ldquo;still
frosty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Water in the wash-hand basin&rsquo;s a mask o&rsquo; ice,
sir,&rdquo; responded Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Severe weather, Sam,&rdquo; observed Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine time for them as is well wropped up, as the Polar Bear
said to himself, ven he was practising his skating,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be down in a quarter of an hour, Sam,&rdquo; said Mr.
Pickwick, untying his nightcap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wery good, sir,&rdquo; replied Sam. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a couple o&rsquo; Sawbones
downstairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A couple of what!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, sitting up
in bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A couple o&rsquo; Sawbones,&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a Sawbones?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick, not quite
certain whether it was a live animal, or something to eat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! Don&rsquo;t you know what a Sawbones is, sir?&rdquo; inquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Mr. Weller. &ldquo;I thought everybody know&rsquo;d as a Sawbones was a
surgeon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, a surgeon, eh?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just that, sir,&rdquo; replied Sam. &ldquo;These here ones as is below,
though, ain&rsquo;t reg&rsquo;lar thorough-bred Sawbones; they&rsquo;re only in
trainin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In other words they&rsquo;re medical students, I suppose?&rdquo; said
Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>Sam Weller nodded assent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad of it,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, casting his nightcap
energetically on the counterpane. &ldquo;They are fine fellows; very
fine fellows; with judgments matured by observation and reflection;
tastes refined by reading and study. I am very glad of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re a smokin&rsquo; cigars by the kitchen fire,&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; observed Mr. Pickwick, rubbing his hands, &ldquo;overflowing
with kindly feelings and animal spirits. Just what I like
to see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And one on &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said Sam, not noticing his master&rsquo;s interruption,
&ldquo;one on &rsquo;em&rsquo;s got his legs on the table, and is a drinkin&rsquo;
brandy neat, vile the tother one&mdash;him in the barnacles&mdash;has got
a barrel o&rsquo; oysters atween his knees, wich he&rsquo;s a openin&rsquo; like steam,
and as fast as he eats &rsquo;em, he takes a aim vith the shells at young
dropsy, who&rsquo;s a sittin&rsquo; down fast asleep, in the chimbley corner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eccentricities of genius, Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;You
may retire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam did retire accordingly; Mr. Pickwick, at the expiration of
the quarter of an hour, went down to breakfast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here he is at last!&rdquo; said old Mr. Wardle. &ldquo;Pickwick, this
is Miss Allen&rsquo;s brother, Mr. Benjamin Allen. Ben we call him,
and so may you if you like. This gentleman is his very particular
friend, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bob Sawyer,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Benjamin Allen; whereupon
Mr. Bob Sawyer and Mr. Benjamin Allen laughed in concert.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick bowed to Bob Sawyer, and Bob Sawyer bowed to
Mr. Pickwick; Bob and his very particular friend then applied
themselves most assiduously to the eatables before them, and Mr.
Pickwick had an opportunity of glancing at them both.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Benjamin Allen was a coarse, stout, thickset young man,
with black hair cut rather short, and a white face cut rather long.
He was embellished with spectacles, and wore a white neckerchief.
Below his single-breasted black surtout, which was buttoned up to
his chin, appeared the usual number of pepper-and-salt coloured
legs, terminating in a pair of imperfectly polished boots. Although
his coat was short in the sleeves, it disclosed no vestige of a linen
wristband; and although there was quite enough of his face to
admit of the encroachment of a shirt collar, it was not graced by
the smallest approach to that appendage. He presented, altogether,
rather a mildewy appearance, and emitted a fragrant odour of full-flavoured
Cubas.</p>

<p>Mr. Bob Sawyer, who was habited in a coarse blue coat, which,
without being either a great-coat or a surtout, partook of the nature
and qualities of both, had about him that sort of slovenly smartness,
and swaggering gait, which is peculiar to young gentlemen who
smoke in the streets by day, shout and scream in the same by night,
call waiters by their Christian names, and do various other acts
and deeds of an equally facetious description. He wore a pair of
plaid trousers, and a large rough double-breasted waistcoat; out of
doors, he carried a thick stick with a big top. He eschewed gloves,
and looked, upon the whole, something like a dissipated Robinson
Crusoe.</p>

<p>Such were the two worthies to whom Mr. Pickwick was introduced,
as he took his seat at the breakfast table on Christmas
morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Splendid morning, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>Mr. Bob Sawyer slightly nodded his assent to the proposition,
and asked Mr. Benjamin Allen for the mustard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you come far this morning, gentlemen?&rdquo; inquired Mr.
Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blue Lion at Muggleton,&rdquo; briefly responded Mr. Allen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should have joined us last night,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So we should,&rdquo; replied Bob Sawyer, &ldquo;but the brandy was too
good to leave in a hurry: wasn&rsquo;t it, Ben?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Mr. Benjamin Allen; &ldquo;and the cigars were
not bad, or the pork chops either: were they, Bob?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Decidedly not,&rdquo; said Bob. The particular friends resumed
their attack upon the breakfast, more freely than before, as if the
recollection of last night&rsquo;s supper had imparted a new relish to
the meal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peg away, Bob,&rdquo; said Mr. Allen to his companion, encouragingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I do,&rdquo; replied Bob Sawyer. And so, to do him justice,
he did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing like dissecting, to give one an appetite,&rdquo; said Mr.
Bob Sawyer, looking round the table.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick slightly shuddered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By-the-bye, Bob,&rdquo; said Mr. Allen, &ldquo;have you finished that
leg yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nearly,&rdquo; replied Sawyer, helping himself to half a fowl as he
spoke. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very muscular one for a child&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Allen, carelessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; said Bob Sawyer, with his mouth full.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve put my name down for an arm, at our place,&rdquo; said Mr.
Allen. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re clubbing for a subject, and the list is nearly full,
only we can&rsquo;t get hold of any fellow that wants a head. I wish
you&rsquo;d take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Bob Sawyer; &ldquo;can&rsquo;t afford expensive luxuries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Allen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t indeed,&rdquo; rejoined Bob Sawyer. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind a
brain, but I couldn&rsquo;t stand a whole head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, hush, gentlemen, pray,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;I hear
the ladies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Mr. Pickwick spoke, the ladies, gallantly escorted by
Messrs. Snodgrass, Winkle, and Tupman, returned from an early
walk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Ben!&rdquo; said Arabella, in a tone which expressed more
surprise than pleasure at the sight of her brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come to take you home to-morrow,&rdquo; replied Benjamin.</p>

<p>Mr. Winkle turned pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see Bob Sawyer, Arabella?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Benjamin
Allen, somewhat reproachfully. Arabella gracefully held out
her hand, in acknowledgment of Bob Sawyer&rsquo;s presence. A thrill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
of hatred struck to Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s heart, as Bob Sawyer inflicted on
the proffered hand a perceptible squeeze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ben, dear!&rdquo; said Arabella, blushing; &ldquo;have&mdash;have&mdash;you been
introduced to Mr. Winkle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not been, but I shall be very happy to be, Arabella,&rdquo;
replied her brother, gravely. Here Mr. Allen bowed grimly to
Mr. Winkle, while Mr. Winkle and Mr. Bob Sawyer glanced
mutual distrust out of the corners of their eyes.</p>

<p>The arrival of the two new visitors, and the consequent check
upon Mr. Winkle and the young lady with the fur round her boots,
would in all probability have proved a very unpleasant interruption
to the hilarity of the party, had not the cheerfulness of Mr. Pickwick,
and the good humour of the host, been exerted to the very
utmost for the common weal. Mr. Winkle gradually insinuated
himself into the good graces of Mr. Benjamin Allen, and even
joined in a friendly conversation with Mr. Bob Sawyer; who,
enlivened with the brandy, and the breakfast, and the talking,
gradually ripened into a state of extreme facetiousness, and related
with much glee an agreeable anecdote, about the removal of a
tumour on some gentleman&rsquo;s head: which he illustrated by means
of an oyster-knife and a half-quartern loaf, to the great edification
of the assembled company. Then, the whole train went to church,
where Mr. Benjamin Allen fell fast asleep; while Mr. Bob Sawyer
abstracted his thoughts from worldly matters, by the ingenious
process of carving his name on the seat of the pew, in corpulent
letters of four inches long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Wardle, after a substantial lunch, with the agreeable
items of strong beer and cherry-brandy, had been done ample
justice to; &ldquo;what say you to an hour on the ice? We shall have
plenty of time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Capital!&rdquo; said Mr. Benjamin Allen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prime!&rdquo; ejaculated Mr. Bob Sawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You skate, of course, Winkle?&rdquo; said Wardle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye-yes, oh yes,&rdquo; replied Mr. Winkle. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;am <em>rather</em> out
of practice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, <em>do</em> skate, Mr. Winkle,&rdquo; said Arabella. &ldquo;I like to see it
so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is <em>so</em> graceful,&rdquo; said another young lady.</p>

<p>A third young lady said it was elegant, and a fourth expressed
her opinion that it was &ldquo;swan-like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should be very happy, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Mr. Winkle, reddening;
&ldquo;but I have no skates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This objection was at once overruled. Trundle had a couple of
pair, and the fat boy announced that there were half a dozen more
down-stairs: whereat Mr. Winkle expressed exquisite delight, and
looked exquisitely uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Old Wardle led the way to a pretty large sheet of ice; and the
fat boy and Mr. Weller having shovelled and swept away the snow
which had fallen on it during the night, Mr. Bob Sawyer adjusted
his skates with a dexterity which to Mr. Winkle was perfectly
marvellous, and described circles with his left leg, and cut figures
of eight, and inscribed upon the ice, without once stopping
for breath, a great many other pleasant and astonishing devices,
to the excessive satisfaction of Mr. Pickwick, Mr. Tupman,
and the ladies: which reached a pitch of positive enthusiasm,
when old Wardle and Benjamin Allen, assisted by the aforesaid
Bob Sawyer, performed some mystic evolutions, which they
called a reel.</p>

<p>All this time, Mr. Winkle, with his face and hands blue with
the cold, had been forcing a gimlet into the soles of his feet, and
putting his skates on, with the points behind, and getting the straps
into a very complicated and entangled state, with the assistance of
Mr. Snodgrass, who knew rather less about skates than a Hindoo.
At length, however, with the assistance of Mr. Weller, the unfortunate
skates were firmly screwed and buckled on, and Mr. Winkle
was raised to his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now then, sir,&rdquo; said Sam, in an encouraging tone; &ldquo;off vith
you, and show &rsquo;em how to do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop, Sam, stop!&rdquo; said Mr. Winkle, trembling violently, and
clutching hold of Sam&rsquo;s arms with the grasp of a drowning man.
&ldquo;How slippery it is, Sam!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not an uncommon thing upon ice, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller.
&ldquo;Hold up, sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This last observation of Mr. Weller&rsquo;s bore reference to a demonstration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Mr. Winkle made at the instant, of a frantic desire to throw
his feet in the air, and dash the back of his head on the ice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These&mdash;these&mdash;are very awkward skates; ain&rsquo;t they, Sam?&rdquo;
inquired Mr. Winkle, staggering.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 361px;"><a id="ill01"></a>
<img src="images/ill01.png" width="361" height="474" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>&ldquo;Now then, sir,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;off vith you, and show &rsquo;em
how to do it&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afeerd there&rsquo;s a orkard gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n in &rsquo;em, sir,&rdquo; replied Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Winkle,&rdquo; cried Mr. Pickwick, quite unconscious that
there was anything the matter. &ldquo;Come; the ladies are all
anxiety.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; replied Mr. Winkle, with a ghastly smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a goin&rsquo; to begin,&rdquo; said Sam, endeavouring to disengage
himself. &ldquo;Now, sir, start off!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop an instant, Sam,&rdquo; gasped Mr. Winkle, clinging most
affectionately to Mr. Weller. &ldquo;I find I&rsquo;ve got a couple of coats at
home I don&rsquo;t want, Sam. You may have them, Sam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank&rsquo;ee, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind touching your hat, Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Winkle,
hastily. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t take your hand away to do that. I meant
to have given you five shillings this morning for a Christmas-box,
Sam. I&rsquo;ll give it you this afternoon, Sam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wery good, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just hold me at first, Sam; will you?&rdquo; said Mr. Winkle.
&ldquo;There&mdash;that&rsquo;s right. I shall soon get in the way of it, Sam.
Not too fast, Sam; not too fast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Winkle stooping forward, with his body half doubled up,
was being assisted over the ice by Mr. Weller, in a most singular and
un-swan-like manner, when Mr. Pickwick most innocently shouted
from the opposite bank:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sam!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here. I want you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let go, sir,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you hear the governor a
callin&rsquo;? Let go, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a violent effort, Mr. Weller disengaged himself from the
grasp of the agonised Pickwickian, and, in so doing, administered
a considerable impetus to the unhappy Mr. Winkle. With an
accuracy which no degree of dexterity or practice could have
insured, that unfortunate gentleman bore swiftly down into the
centre of the reel, at the very moment when Mr. Bob Sawyer was
performing a flourish of unparalleled beauty. Mr. Winkle struck
wildly against him, and with a loud crash they both fell heavily
down. Mr. Pickwick ran to the spot. Bob Sawyer had risen to
his feet, but Mr. Winkle was far too wise to do anything of the
kind, in skates. He was seated on the ice, making spasmodic
efforts to smile; but anguish was depicted on every lineament of
his countenance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Benjamin Allen, with great
anxiety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; said Mr. Winkle, rubbing his back very hard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d let me bleed you,&rdquo; said Mr. Benjamin with great
eagerness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; replied Mr. Winkle, hurriedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really think you had better,&rdquo; said Allen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; replied Mr. Winkle; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do <em>you</em> think, Mr. Pickwick?&rdquo; inquired Bob Sawyer.
Mr. Pickwick was excited and indignant. He beckoned to Mr.
Weller, and said in a stern voice, &ldquo;Take his skates off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; but really I had scarcely begun,&rdquo; remonstrated Mr.
Winkle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take his skates off,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Pickwick, firmly.</p>

<p>The command was not to be resisted. Mr. Winkle allowed
Sam to obey it in silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lift him up,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick. Sam assisted him to rise.
Mr. Pickwick retired a few paces apart from the bystanders;
and, beckoning his friend to approach, fixed a searching look upon
him, and uttered in a low, but distinct and emphatic tone, these
remarkable words:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a humbug, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo; said Mr. Winkle, starting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A humbug, sir. I will speak plainer, if you wish it. An
impostor, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With these words, Mr. Pickwick turned slowly on his heel, and
rejoined his friends.</p>

<p>While Mr. Pickwick was delivering himself of the sentiment
just recorded, Mr. Weller and the fat boy, having by their joint
endeavours cut out a slide, were exercising themselves thereupon,
in a very masterly and brilliant manner. Sam Weller, in particular,
was displaying that beautiful feat of fancy sliding which is currently
denominated &ldquo;knocking at the cobbler&rsquo;s door,&rdquo; and which is
achieved by skimming over the ice on one foot, and occasionally
giving a postman&rsquo;s knock upon it with the other. It was a good long
slide, and there was something in the motion which Mr. Pickwick,
who was very cold with standing still, could not help envying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks a nice warm exercise that, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he inquired of
Wardle, when that gentleman was thoroughly out of breath, by
reason of the indefatigable manner in which he had converted his
legs into a pair of compasses, and drawn complicated problems on
the ice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, it does indeed,&rdquo; replied Wardle. &ldquo;Do you slide?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I used to do so, on the gutters, when I was a boy,&rdquo; replied
Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<div class="figright"><a id="ill02"></a>
<img src="images/ill02.png" width="229" height="309" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>Went slowly and gravely down
the slide</p>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Try it now,&rdquo; said Wardle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh do, please, Mr. Pickwick!&rdquo;
cried all the ladies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should be very happy to
afford you any amusement,&rdquo; replied
Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;but I haven&rsquo;t done
such a thing these thirty years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh! pooh! Nonsense!&rdquo; said
Wardle, dragging off his skates with
the impetuosity which characterised
all his proceedings. &ldquo;Here; I&rsquo;ll
keep you company; come along!&rdquo;
And away went the good-tempered
old fellow down the slide, with a
rapidity which came very close upon
Mr. Weller, and beat the fat boy all
to nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick paused, considered,
pulled off his gloves and put them in
his hat: took two or three short runs, baulked himself as often,
and at last took another run, and went slowly and gravely
down the slide, with his feet about a yard and a quarter apart,
amidst the gratified shouts of all the spectators.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep the pot a bilin&rsquo;, sir!&rdquo; said Sam; and down went
Wardle again, and then Mr. Pickwick, and then Sam, and then
Mr. Winkle, and then Mr. Bob Sawyer, and then the fat boy,
and then Mr. Snodgrass, following closely upon each other&rsquo;s heels,
and running after each other with as much eagerness as if all their
future prospects in life depended on their expedition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the most intensely interesting thing, to observe the
manner in which Mr. Pickwick performed his share in the ceremony;
to watch the torture of anxiety with which he viewed the person
behind, gaining upon him at the imminent hazard of tripping him
up; to see him gradually expend the painful force he had put on
at first, and turn slowly round on the slide, with his face towards
the point from which he had started; to contemplate the playful
smile which mantled on his face when he had accomplished the
distance, and the eagerness with which he turned round when he
had done so, and ran after his predecessor: his black gaiters tripping
pleasantly through the snow, and his eyes beaming cheerfulness
and gladness through his spectacles. And when he was knocked
down (which happened upon the average every third round), it
was the most invigorating sight that can possibly be imagined, to
behold him gather up his hat, gloves, and handkerchief, with a
glowing countenance, and resume his station in the rank, with an
ardour and enthusiasm that nothing could abate.</p>

<p>The sport was at its height, the sliding was at the quickest, the
laughter was at the loudest, when a sharp smart crack was heard.
There was a quick rush towards the bank, a wild scream from the
ladies, and a shout from Mr. Tupman. A large mass of ice disappeared;
the water bubbled up over it; Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s hat, gloves,
and handkerchief were floating on the surface; and this was all of
Mr. Pickwick that anybody could see.</p>

<p>Dismay and anguish were depicted on every countenance, the
males turned pale, and the females fainted, Mr. Snodgrass and
Mr. Winkle grasped each other by the hand, and gazed at the spot
where their leader had gone down, with frenzied eagerness; while
Mr. Tupman, by way of rendering the promptest assistance, and
at the same time conveying to any persons who might be within
hearing, the clearest possible notion of the catastrophe, ran off
across the country at his utmost speed, screaming &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; with
all his might.</p>

<p>It was at this moment, when old Wardle and Sam Weller were
approaching the hole with cautious steps, and Mr. Benjamin Allen
was holding a hurried consultation with Bob Sawyer, on the
advisability of bleeding the company generally, as an improving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
little bit of professional practice&mdash;it was at this very moment, that
a face, head, and shoulders, emerged from beneath the water, and
disclosed the features and spectacles of Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 626px;"><a id="color02"></a>
<img src="images/color02.jpg" width="626" height="461" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>A face, head, and shoulders,
emerged from beneath the water,
and disclosed the features and
spectacles of Mr. Pickwick.</p>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Keep yourself up for an instant&mdash;for only one instant;&rdquo;
bawled Mr. Snodgrass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, do; let me implore you&mdash;for my sake!&rdquo; roared Mr.
Winkle, deeply affected. The adjuration was rather unnecessary:
the probability being, that if Mr. Pickwick; had declined to keep
himself up for anybody else&rsquo;s sake, it would have occurred to him
that he might as well do so for his own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you feel the bottom there, old fellow?&rdquo; said Wardle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, certainly,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, wringing the water from
his head and face, and gasping for breath. &ldquo;I fell upon my back.
I couldn&rsquo;t get on my feet at first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The clay upon so much of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s coat as was yet visible,
bore testimony to the accuracy of this statement; and as the fears
of the spectators were still further relieved by the fat boy&rsquo;s suddenly
recollecting that the water was nowhere more than five feet deep,
prodigies of valour were performed to get him out. After a vast
quantity of splashing, and cracking, and struggling, Mr. Pickwick
was at length fairly extricated from his unpleasant position, and
once more stood on dry land.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll catch his death of cold,&rdquo; said Emily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear old thing!&rdquo; said Arabella. &ldquo;Let me wrap this shawl
round you, Mr. Pickwick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s the best thing you can do,&rdquo; said Wardle; &ldquo;and
when you&rsquo;ve got it on, run home as fast as your legs can carry you,
and jump into bed directly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A dozen shawls were offered on the instant. Three or four of
the thickest having been selected, Mr. Pickwick was wrapped up,
and started off, under the guidance of Mr. Weller: presenting the
singular phenomenon of an elderly gentleman, dripping wet, and
without a hat, with his arms bound down to his sides, skimming over
the ground, without any clearly defined purpose, at the rate of
six good English miles an hour.</p>

<p>But Mr. Pickwick cared not for appearances in such an extreme
case, and urged on by Sam Weller, he kept at the very top of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
speed until he reached the door of Manor Farm, where Mr.
Tupman had arrived some five minutes before, and had frightened
the old lady into palpitations of the heart by impressing her with
the unalterable conviction that the kitchen chimney was on fire&mdash;a
calamity which always presented itself in glowing colours to
the old lady&rsquo;s mind, when anybody about her evinced the smallest
agitation.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick paused not an instant until he was snug in bed.
Sam Weller lighted a blazing fire in the room and took up his
dinner; a bowl of punch was carried up afterwards, and a grand
carouse held in honour of his safety. Old Wardle would not hear
of his rising, so they made the bed the chair, and Mr. Pickwick
presided. A second and a third bowl were ordered in; and when
Mr. Pickwick awoke next morning, there was not a symptom of
rheumatism about him: which proves, as Mr. Bob Sawyer very
justly observed, that there is nothing like hot punch in such cases:
and that if ever hot punch did fail to act as a preventive, it was
merely because the patient fell into the vulgar error of not taking
enough of it.</p>

<p>The jovial party broke up next morning. Breakings up are
capital things in our school days, but in after life they are painful
enough. Death, self-interest, and fortune&rsquo;s changes, are every day
breaking up many a happy group, and scattering them far and
wide; and the boys and girls never come back again. We do not
mean to say that it was exactly the case in this particular instance;
all we wish to inform the reader is, that the different members of
the party dispersed to their several homes; that Mr. Pickwick and
his friends once more took their seats on the top of the Muggleton
coach; and that Arabella Allen repaired to her place of destination,
wherever it might have been&mdash;we dare say Mr. Winkle
knew, but we confess we don&rsquo;t&mdash;under the care and guardianship
of her brother Benjamin, and his most intimate friend, Mr. Bob
Sawyer.</p>

<p>Before they separated, however, that gentleman and Mr. Benjamin
Allen drew Mr. Pickwick aside with an air of some mystery:
and Mr. Bob Sawyer, thrusting his forefinger between two of Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s ribs, and thereby displaying his native drollery, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
knowledge of the anatomy of the human frame, at one and the
same time, inquired:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, old boy, where do you hang out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick replied that he was at present suspended at the
George and Vulture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d come and see me,&rdquo; said Bob Sawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing would give me greater pleasure,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s my lodgings,&rdquo; said Mr. Bob Sawyer, producing a card.
&ldquo;Lant Street, Borough; it&rsquo;s near Guy&rsquo;s, and handy for me, you
know. Little distance after you&rsquo;ve passed St. George&rsquo;s Church&mdash;turns
out of the High Street on the right-hand side the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall find it,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on Thursday fortnight, and bring the other chaps with
you,&rdquo; said Mr. Bob Sawyer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have a few medical
fellows that night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick expressed the pleasure it would afford him to
meet the medical fellows; and after Mr. Bob Sawyer had informed
him that he meant to be very cosy, and that his friend Ben was
to be one of the party, they shook hands and separated.</p>

<p>We feel that in this place we lay ourselves open to inquiry
whether Mr. Winkle was whispering, during this brief conversation,
to Arabella Allen; and if so, what he said; and furthermore,
whether Mr. Snodgrass was conversing apart with Emily Wardle;
and if so, what <em>he</em> said. To this, we reply, that whatever they
might have said to the ladies, they said nothing at all to Mr. Pickwick
or Mr. Tupman for eight-and-twenty miles, and that they sighed
very often, refused ale and brandy, and looked gloomy. If our
observant lady readers can deduce any satisfactory inferences from
these facts, we beg them by all means to do so.</p>

<p class="cap pd10"><span class="upper">Scattered</span> about, in
various holes and corners
of the Temple, are certain
dark and dirty chambers,
in and out of which, all
the morning in Vacation,
and half the evening too
in Term times, there may
be seen constantly hurrying with bundles of papers under
their arms, and protruding from their pockets, an almost
uninterrupted succession of Lawyers&rsquo; Clerks. There are several
grades of Lawyers&rsquo; Clerks. There is the Articled Clerk, who
has paid a premium, and is an attorney in perspective, who
runs a tailor&rsquo;s bill, receives invitations to parties, knows a family
in Gower Street, and another in Tavistock Square; who goes
out of town every Long Vacation to see his father, who keeps
live horses innumerable; and who is, in short, the very aristocrat
of clerks. There is the salaried clerk&mdash;out of door or in door, as the
case may be&mdash;who devotes the major part of his thirty shillings a
week to his personal pleasure and adornment, repairs half-price to
the Adelphi Theatre at least three times a week, dissipates majestically
at the cider cellars afterwards, and is a dirty caricature of the
fashion which expired six months ago. There is the middle-aged
copying clerk, with a large family, who is always shabby, and often
drunk. And there are the office lads in their first surtouts, who
feel a befitting contempt for boys at day-schools; club, as they go
home at night, for saveloys and porter; and think there&rsquo;s nothing
like &ldquo;life.&rdquo; There are varieties of the genus, too numerous to
recapitulate, but however numerous they may be, they are all to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
be seen, at certain regulated business hours, hurrying to and from
the places we have just mentioned.</p>

<p>These sequestered nooks are the public offices of the legal
profession, where writs are issued, judgments signed, declarations
filed, and numerous other ingenious machines put in motion for
the torture and torment of His Majesty&rsquo;s liege subjects, and the
comfort and emolument of the practitioners of the law. They are,
for the most part, low-roofed, mouldy rooms, where innumerable
rolls of parchment, which have been perspiring in secret for the
last century, send forth an agreeable odour, which is mingled by
day with the scent of the dry rot, and by night with the various
exhalations which arise from damp cloaks, festering umbrellas, and
the coarsest tallow candles.</p>

<p>About half-past seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening, some ten days or a
fortnight after Mr. Pickwick and his friends returned to London,
there hurried into one of these offices, an individual in a brown
coat and brass buttons, whose long hair was scrupulously twisted
round the rim of his napless hat, and whose soiled drab trousers
were so tightly strapped over his Blucher boots, that his knees
threatened every moment to start from their concealment. He
produced from his coat pocket a long and narrow strip of parchment,
on which the presiding functionary impressed an illegible
black stamp. He then drew forth four scraps of paper, of
similar dimensions, each containing a printed copy of the strip
of parchment with blanks for a name; and having filled up
the blanks, put all the five documents in his pocket, and hurried
away.</p>

<p>The man in the brown coat, with the cabalistic documents in his
pocket, was no other than our old acquaintance Mr. Jackson, of
the house of Dodson and Fogg, Freeman&rsquo;s Court, Cornhill. Instead
of returning to the office from whence he came, however, he
bent his steps direct to Sun Court, and walking straight into the
George and Vulture, demanded to know whether one Mr. Pickwick
was within.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s servant, Tom,&rdquo; said the barmaid of the
George and Vulture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble yourself,&rdquo; said Mr. Jackson, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
business. If you&rsquo;ll show me Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s room I&rsquo;ll step up
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What name, sir?&rdquo; said the waiter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jackson,&rdquo; replied the clerk.</p>

<p>The waiter stepped up-stairs to announce Mr. Jackson; but
Mr. Jackson saved him the trouble by following close at his heels,
and walking into the apartment before he could articulate a syllable.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick had, that day, invited his three friends to dinner;
they were all seated round the fire, drinking their wine, when Mr.
Jackson presented himself, as above described.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How de do, sir?&rdquo; said Mr. Jackson, nodding to Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>That gentleman bowed, and looked somewhat surprised, for the
physiognomy of Mr. Jackson dwelt not on his recollection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have called from Dodson and Fogg&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Mr. Jackson, in
an explanatory tone.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick roused at the name. &ldquo;I refer you to my attorney,
sir: Mr. Perker, of Gray&rsquo;s Inn,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Waiter, show this
gentleman out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beg your pardon, Mr. Pickwick,&rdquo; said Jackson, deliberately
depositing his hat on the floor, and drawing from his pocket the
strip of parchment. &ldquo;But personal service, by clerk or agent, in
these cases, you know, Mr. Pickwick&mdash;nothing like caution, sir, in
all legal forms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Mr. Jackson cast his eye on the parchment; and resting his
hands on the table, and looking round with a winning and persuasive
smile, said: &ldquo;Now, come; don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s have no words about such a
little matter as this. Which of you gentlemen&rsquo;s name&rsquo;s Snodgrass?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this inquiry Mr. Snodgrass gave such a very undisguised and
palpable start, that no further reply was needed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! I thought so,&rdquo; said Mr. Jackson, more affably than
before. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a little something to trouble you with, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Snodgrass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">subp&oelig;na</i> in Bardell and Pickwick on behalf of the
plaintiff,&rdquo; replied Mr. Jackson, singling out one of the slips of
paper, and producing a shilling from his waistcoat pocket. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll
come on, in the settens after Term; fourteenth of Febooary, we
expect; we&rsquo;ve marked it a special jury cause, and it&rsquo;s only ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
down the paper. That&rsquo;s yours, Mr. Snodgrass.&rdquo; As Jackson said
this he presented the parchment before the eyes of Mr. Snodgrass,
and slipped the paper and the shilling into his hand.</p>

<p>Mr. Tupman had witnessed this process in silent astonishment,
when Jackson, turning sharply upon him, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I ain&rsquo;t mistaken when I say your name&rsquo;s Tupman,
am I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Tupman looked at Mr. Pickwick; but, perceiving no
encouragement in that gentleman&rsquo;s widely opened eyes to deny
his name, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my name <em>is</em> Tupman, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that other gentleman&rsquo;s Mr. Winkle, I think?&rdquo; said
Jackson.</p>

<p>Mr. Winkle faltered out a reply in the affirmative; and both
gentlemen were forthwith invested with a slip of paper, and a
shilling each, by the dexterous Mr. Jackson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Jackson, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll think me rather
troublesome, but I want somebody else, if it ain&rsquo;t inconvenient.
I <em>have</em> Samuel Weller&rsquo;s name here, Mr. Pickwick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send my servant here, waiter,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick. The
waiter retired, considerably astonished, and Mr. Pickwick motioned
Jackson to a seat.</p>

<p>There was a painful pause, which was at length broken by the
innocent defendant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, his indignation rising
while he spoke; &ldquo;I suppose, sir, that it is the intention of your
employers to seek to criminate me upon the testimony of my
own friends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Jackson struck his forefinger several times against the left
side of his nose, to intimate that he was not there to disclose the
secrets of the prison-house, and playfully rejoined:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not knowin&rsquo;, can&rsquo;t say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For what other reason, sir,&rdquo; pursued Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;are
these subp&oelig;nas served upon them, if not for this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good plant, Mr. Pickwick,&rdquo; replied Jackson, slowly
shaking his head. &ldquo;But it won&rsquo;t do. No harm in trying, but
there&rsquo;s little to be got out of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Here Mr. Jackson smiled once more upon the company, and,
applying his left thumb to the tip of his nose, worked a visionary
coffee-mill with his right hand: thereby performing a very graceful
piece of pantomime (then much in vogue, but now, unhappily,
almost obsolete) which was familiarly denominated &ldquo;taking a
grinder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, Mr. Pickwick,&rdquo; said Jackson, in conclusion; &ldquo;Perker&rsquo;s
people must guess what we&rsquo;ve served these subp&oelig;nas for. If they
can&rsquo;t, they must wait till the action comes on, and then they&rsquo;ll
find out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick bestowed a look of excessive disgust on his unwelcome
visitor, and would probably have hurled some tremendous
anathema at the heads of Messrs. Dodson and Fogg, had not Sam&rsquo;s
entrance at the instant interrupted him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Samuel Weller?&rdquo; said Mr. Jackson, inquiringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vun o&rsquo; the truest things as you&rsquo;ve said for many a long year,&rdquo;
replied Sam, in a most composed manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a subp&oelig;na for you, Mr. Weller,&rdquo; said Jackson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that in English?&rdquo; inquired Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the original,&rdquo; said Jackson, declining the required explanation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which?&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; replied Jackson, shaking the parchment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s the &rsquo;rig&rsquo;nal, is it?&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m wery
glad I&rsquo;ve seen the &rsquo;rig&rsquo;nal, &rsquo;cos it&rsquo;s a gratifyin&rsquo; sort o&rsquo; thing, and
eases vun&rsquo;s mind so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And here&rsquo;s the shilling,&rdquo; said Jackson. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s from Dodson
and Fogg&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s uncommon handsome o&rsquo; Dodson and Fogg, as knows
so little of me, to come down vith a present,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;I feel it
as a wery high compliment, sir; it&rsquo;s a wery hon&rsquo;rable thing to
them, as they knows how to reward merit werever they meets it.
Besides wich, it&rsquo;s affectin&rsquo; to one&rsquo;s feelin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Mr. Weller said this, he inflicted a little friction on his right
eyelid, with the sleeve of his coat, after the most approved manner
of actors when they are in domestic pathetics.</p>

<p>Mr. Jackson seemed rather puzzled by Sam&rsquo;s proceedings; but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
as he had served the subp&oelig;nas, and had nothing more to say, he
made a feint of putting on the one glove which he usually carried
in his hand for the sake of appearances; and returned to the office
to report progress.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick slept little that night; his memory had received a
very disagreeable refresher on the subject of Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s action.
He breakfasted betimes next morning, and, desiring Sam to accompany
him, set forth towards Gray&rsquo;s Inn Square.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sam!&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, looking round, when they got to
the end of Cheapside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir?&rdquo; said Sam, stepping up to his master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Up Newgate Street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick did not turn round immediately, but looked
vacantly in Sam&rsquo;s face for a few seconds, and heaved a deep sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, sir?&rdquo; inquired Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This action, Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;is expected to come on
on the fourteenth of next month.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remarkable coin<em>ci</em>dence that &rsquo;ere, sir,&rdquo; replied Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why remarkable, Sam?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Walentine&rsquo;s day, sir,&rdquo; responded Sam; &ldquo;reg&rsquo;lar good day for
a breach o&rsquo; promise trial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Weller&rsquo;s smile awakened no gleam of mirth in his master&rsquo;s
countenance. Mr. Pickwick turned abruptly round, and led the
way in silence.</p>

<p>They had walked some distance: Mr. Pickwick trotting on
before, plunged in profound meditation, and Sam following behind,
with a countenance expressive of the most enviable and easy
defiance of everything and everybody: when the latter, who was
always especially anxious to impart to his master any exclusive
information he possessed, quickened his pace until he was close at
Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s heels; and, pointing up at a house they were
passing, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wery nice pork-shop that &rsquo;ere, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it seems so,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Celebrated sassage factory,&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it!&rdquo; reiterated Sam, with some indignation: &ldquo;I should
rayther think it was. Why, sir, bless your innocent eyebrows,
that&rsquo;s where the mysterious disappearance of a &rsquo;spectable tradesman
took place four year ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say he was burked, Sam?&rdquo; said Mr.
Pickwick, looking hastily round.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t indeed, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller, &ldquo;I wish I did;
far worse than that. He was the master o&rsquo; that &rsquo;ere shop, sir, and
the inwenter o&rsquo; the patent never-leavin&rsquo;-off sassage steam ingine, as
&rsquo;ud swaller up a pavin&rsquo; stone if you put it too near, and grind it into
sassages as easy as if it was a tender young baby. Wery proud
o&rsquo; that machine he was, as it was nat&rsquo;ral he should be, and he&rsquo;d
stand down in the cellar a lookin&rsquo; at it wen it was in full play, till
he got quite melancholy with joy. A wery happy man he&rsquo;d ha&rsquo;
been, sir, in the procession o&rsquo; that &rsquo;ere ingine and two more lovely
hinfants besides, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for his wife, who was a most
ow-dacious wixin. She was always a follerin&rsquo; him about and dinnin&rsquo;
in his ears, till at last he couldn&rsquo;t stand it no longer. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell
you what it is, my dear,&rsquo; he says one day; &lsquo;if you persewere in
this here sort of amusement,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m blessed if I don&rsquo;t go
away to &rsquo;Merriker; and that&rsquo;s all about it.&rsquo; &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a idle willin,&rsquo;
says she, &lsquo;and I wish the &lsquo;Merrikins joy of their bargain.&rsquo; Arter
wich she keeps on abusin&rsquo; of him for half an hour, and then runs
into the little parlour behind the shop, sets to a screamin&rsquo;, says he&rsquo;ll
be the death on her, and falls in a fit, which lasts for three good
hours&mdash;one o&rsquo; them fits wich is all screamin&rsquo; and kickin&rsquo;. Well,
next mornin&rsquo;, the husband was missin&rsquo;. He hadn&rsquo;t taken nothin&rsquo;
from the till&mdash;hadn&rsquo;t even put on his great-coat&mdash;so it was quite
clear he warn&rsquo;t gone to &rsquo;Merriker. Didn&rsquo;t come back next day;
didn&rsquo;t come back next week; Missis had bills printed, sayin&rsquo; that,
if he&rsquo;d come back, he should be forgiven everythin&rsquo; (which was very
liberal, seein&rsquo; that he hadn&rsquo;t done nothin&rsquo; at all); the canals was
dragged, and for two months artervards, wenever a body turned up,
it was carried, as a reg&rsquo;lar thing, straight off to the sassage shop.
Hows&rsquo;ever, none on &rsquo;em answered; so they gave out that he&rsquo;d
run avay, and she kep&rsquo; on the bis&rsquo;ness. One Saturday night, a little
thin old gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n comes into the shop in a great passion and says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
&lsquo;Are you the missis o&rsquo; this here shop?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, I am,&rsquo; says she.
&lsquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;then I&rsquo;ve just looked in to say that me and
my family ain&rsquo;t a goin&rsquo; to be choked for nothin&rsquo;; and more than
that, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll allow me to observe, that as you don&rsquo;t
use the primest parts of the meat in the manafacter o&rsquo; sassages,
I think you&rsquo;d find beef come nearly as cheap as buttons.&rsquo; &lsquo;As
buttons, sir!&rsquo; says she. &lsquo;Buttons, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; says the little old
gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n, unfolding a bit of paper, and showing twenty or thirty
halves o&rsquo; buttons. &lsquo;Nice seasonin&rsquo; for sassages, is trousers buttons,
ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo; &lsquo;They&rsquo;re my husband&rsquo;s buttons!&rsquo; says the widder, beginnin&rsquo;
to faint. &lsquo;What!&rsquo; screams the little old gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n, turnin&rsquo;
wery pale. &lsquo;I see it all,&rsquo; says the widder; &lsquo;in a fit of temporary
insanity he rashly converted his-self into sassages!&rsquo; And so he
had, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, looking steadily into Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
horror-stricken countenance, &ldquo;or else he&rsquo;d been draw&rsquo;d into the
ingine; but however that might ha&rsquo; been, the little old gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n,
who had been remarkably partial to sassages all his life, rushed out
o&rsquo; the shop in a wild state, and was never heard on artervards!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The relation of this affecting incident of private life brought
master and man to Mr. Perker&rsquo;s chambers. Lowten, holding the
door half open, was in conversation with a rustily-clad, miserable-looking
man, in boots without toes and gloves without fingers.
There were traces of privation and suffering&mdash;almost of despair&mdash;in
his lank and careworn countenance; he felt his poverty, for he
shrunk to the dark side of the staircase as Mr. Pickwick approached.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very unfortunate,&rdquo; said the stranger, with a sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; said Lowten, scribbling his name on the door-post with
his pen, and rubbing it out again with the feather. &ldquo;Will you
leave a message for him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When do you think he&rsquo;ll be back?&rdquo; inquired the stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite uncertain,&rdquo; replied Lowten, winking at Mr. Pickwick,
as the stranger cast his eyes towards the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think it would be of any use my waiting for him?&rdquo;
said the stranger, looking wistfully into the office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, I&rsquo;m sure it wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied the clerk, moving a little
more into the centre of the doorway. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s certain not to be
back this week, and it&rsquo;s a chance whether he will be next; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
when Perker once gets out of town, he&rsquo;s never in a hurry to come
back again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out of town!&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &ldquo;dear me, how unfortunate!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go away, Mr. Pickwick,&rdquo; said Lowten, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a
letter for you.&rdquo; The stranger seeming to hesitate, once more
looked towards the ground, and the clerk winked slily at Mr.
Pickwick, as if to intimate that some exquisite piece of humour was
going forward, though what it was Mr. Pickwick could not for the
life of him divine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Step in, Mr. Pickwick,&rdquo; said Lowten. &ldquo;Well, will you leave a
message, Mr. Watty, or will you call again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask him to be so kind as to leave out word what has been done
in my business,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;for God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t neglect it,
Mr. Lowten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no; I won&rsquo;t forget it,&rdquo; replied the clerk. &ldquo;Walk in,
Mr. Pickwick. Good morning, Mr. Watty; it&rsquo;s a fine day for
walking, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Seeing that the stranger still lingered, he
beckoned Sam Weller to follow his master in, and shut the door
in his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There never was such a pestering bankrupt as that since the
world began, I do believe!&rdquo; said Lowten, throwing down his pen
with the air of an injured man. &ldquo;His affairs haven&rsquo;t been in
Chancery quite four years yet, and I&rsquo;m d&mdash;d if he don&rsquo;t come
worrying here twice a week. Step this way, Mr. Pickwick. Perker
<em>is</em> in, and he&rsquo;ll see you, I know. Devilish cold,&rdquo; he added, pettishly,
&ldquo;standing at that door, wasting one&rsquo;s time with such seedy vagabonds!&rdquo;
Having very vehemently stirred a particularly large fire
with a particularly small poker, the clerk led the way to his principal&rsquo;s
private room, and announced Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my dear sir,&rdquo; said little Mr. Perker, bustling up from his
chair. &ldquo;Well, my dear sir, and what&rsquo;s the news about your matter,
eh? Anything more about our friends in Freeman&rsquo;s Court?
They&rsquo;ve not been sleeping, <em>I</em> know that. Ah, they&rsquo;re smart fellows;
very smart indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the little man concluded, he took an emphatic pinch of snuff,
as a tribute to the smartness of Messrs. Dodson and Fogg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;They are great scoundrels,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye,&rdquo; said the little man; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a matter of opinion,
you know, and we won&rsquo;t dispute about terms; because of course
you can&rsquo;t be expected to view these subjects with a professional
eye. Well, we&rsquo;ve done everything that&rsquo;s necessary. I have retained
Serjeant Snubbin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he a good man?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good man!&rdquo; replied Perker; &ldquo;bless your heart and soul, my
dear sir, Serjeant Snubbin is at the very top of his profession.
Gets treble the business of any man in court&mdash;engaged in every
case. You needn&rsquo;t mention it abroad; but we say&mdash;we of the
profession&mdash;that Serjeant Snubbin leads the court by the nose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little man took another pinch of snuff as he made this
communication, and nodded mysteriously to Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have subp&oelig;na&rsquo;d my three friends,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! of course they would,&rdquo; replied Perker. &ldquo;Important
witnesses; saw you in a delicate situation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she fainted of her own accord,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;She
threw herself into my arms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very likely, my dear sir,&rdquo; replied Perker; &ldquo;very likely and
very natural. Nothing more so, my dear sir, nothing. But who&rsquo;s
to prove it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have subp&oelig;na&rsquo;d my servant too,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick,
quitting the other point; for there Mr. Perker&rsquo;s question had
somewhat staggered him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sam?&rdquo; said Perker.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick replied in the affirmative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, my dear sir; of course. I knew they would. I
could have told you that a month ago. You know, my dear sir, if
you <em>will</em> take the management of your affairs into your own hands
after intrusting them to your solicitor, you must also take the
consequences.&rdquo; Here Mr. Perker drew himself up with conscious
dignity, and brushed some stray grains of snuff from his shirt frill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what do they want him to prove?&rdquo; asked Mr. Pickwick,
after two or three minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you sent him up to the plaintiff&rsquo;s to make some offer of
a compromise, I suppose,&rdquo; replied Perker. &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t matter much,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
though; I don&rsquo;t think many counsel could get a great deal out
of <em>him</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they could,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick; smiling, despite
his vexation, at the idea of Sam&rsquo;s appearance as a witness. &ldquo;What
course do we pursue?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have only one to adopt, my dear sir,&rdquo; replied Perker;
&ldquo;cross-examine the witnesses; trust to Snubbin&rsquo;s eloquence; throw
dust in the eyes of the judge; throw ourselves on the jury.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And suppose the verdict is against me?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>Mr. Perker smiled, took a very long pinch of snuff, stirred the
fire, shrugged his shoulders, and remained expressively silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean that in that case I must pay the damages?&rdquo; said
Mr. Pickwick, who had watched this telegraphic answer with
considerable sternness.</p>

<p>Perker gave the fire another very unnecessary poke, and said, &ldquo;I
am afraid so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I beg to announce to you, my unalterable determination
to pay no damages whatever,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, most emphatically.
&ldquo;None, Perker. Not a pound, not a penny, of my money, shall
find its way into the pockets of Dodson and Fogg. That is my
deliberate and irrevocable determination.&rdquo; Mr. Pickwick gave a
heavy blow on the table before him, in confirmation of the irrevocability
of his intention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, my dear sir, very well,&rdquo; said Perker. &ldquo;You know
best, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, hastily. &ldquo;Where does
Serjeant Snubbin live?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Old Square,&rdquo; replied Perker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to see him,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See Serjeant Snubbin, my dear sir!&rdquo; rejoined Perker, in utter
amazement. &ldquo;Pooh, pooh, my dear sir, impossible. See Serjeant
Snubbin! Bless you, my dear sir, such a thing was never heard
of, without a consultation fee being previously paid, and a consultation
fixed. It couldn&rsquo;t be done, my dear sir; it couldn&rsquo;t be
done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick, however, had made up his mind not only that it
could be done, but that it should be done; and the consequence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
was, that within ten minutes after he had received the assurance
that the thing was impossible, he was conducted by his solicitor into
the outer office of the great Serjeant Snubbin himself.</p>

<p>It was an uncarpeted room of tolerable dimensions, with a large
writing-table drawn up near the fire: the baize top of which had
long since lost all claim to its original hue of green, and had gradually
grown grey with dust and age, except where all traces of its natural
colour were obliterated by ink-stains. Upon the table were
numerous little bundles of papers tied with red tape; and behind
it sat an elderly clerk, whose sleek appearance, and heavy gold
watch-chain, presented imposing indications of the extensive and
lucrative practice of Mr. Serjeant Snubbin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the Serjeant in his room, Mr. Mallard?&rdquo; inquired Perker,
offering his box with all imaginable courtesy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s very busy. Look here;
not an opinion given yet, on any one of these cases; and an expedition
fee paid with all of &rsquo;em.&rdquo; The clerk smiled as he said
this, and inhaled a pinch of snuff with a zest which seemed to be
compounded of a fondness for snuff and a relish for fees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something like practice that,&rdquo; said Perker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the barrister&rsquo;s clerk, producing his own box, and
offering it with the greatest cordiality; &ldquo;and the best of it is, that
as nobody alive except myself can read the Serjeant&rsquo;s writing, they
are obliged to wait for the opinions, when he has given them, till I
have copied &rsquo;em, ha&mdash;ha&mdash;ha!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which makes good for we know who, besides the Serjeant, and
draws a little more out of the clients, eh?&rdquo; said Perker; &ldquo;Ha, ha,
ha!&rdquo; At this the Serjeant&rsquo;s clerk laughed again; not a noisy
boisterous laugh, but a silent, internal chuckle, which Mr. Pickwick
disliked to hear. When a man bleeds inwardly, it is a dangerous
thing for himself; but when he laughs inwardly, it bodes no good
to other people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t made me out that little list of the fees that I&rsquo;m
in your debt, have you?&rdquo; said Perker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I have not,&rdquo; replied the clerk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you would,&rdquo; said Perker. &ldquo;Let me have them, and I&rsquo;ll
send you a cheque. But I suppose you&rsquo;re too busy pocketing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
ready money, to think of the debtors, eh? ha, ha, ha!&rdquo; This sally
seemed to tickle the clerk amazingly, and he once more enjoyed a
little quiet laugh to himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. Mallard, my dear friend,&rdquo; said Perker, suddenly recovering
his gravity, and drawing the great man&rsquo;s great man into a
corner, by the lappel of his coat; &ldquo;you must persuade the Serjeant
to see me and my client here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said the clerk, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not bad either. See
the Serjeant! come, that&rsquo;s too absurd.&rdquo; Notwithstanding the
absurdity of the proposal, however, the clerk allowed himself to be
gently drawn beyond the hearing of Mr. Pickwick; and after a
short conversation conducted in whispers, walked softly down a little
dark passage and disappeared into the legal luminary&rsquo;s sanctum:
whence he shortly returned on tiptoe, and informed Mr. Perker and
Mr. Pickwick that the Serjeant had been prevailed upon, in violation
of all established rules and customs, to admit them at once.</p>

<p>Mr. Serjeant Snubbin was a lantern-faced, sallow-complexioned
man, of about five-and-forty, or&mdash;as the novels say&mdash;he might be
fifty. He had that dull-looking boiled eye which is often to be
seen in the heads of people who have applied themselves during
many years to a weary and laborious course of study; and which
would have been sufficient, without the additional eye-glass which
dangled from a broad black riband round his neck, to warn a
stranger that he was very near-sighted. His hair was thin and
weak, which was partly attributable to his having never devoted
much time to its arrangement, and partly to his having worn for
five-and-twenty years the forensic wig which hung on a block beside
him. The marks of hair-powder on his coat-collar, and the ill-washed
and worse-tied white neckerchief round his throat, showed
that he had not found leisure since he left the court to make any
alteration in his dress: while the slovenly style of the remainder
of his costume warranted the inference that his personal appearance
would not have been very much improved if he had. Books of
practice, heaps of papers, and opened letters, were scattered over
the table, without any attempt at order or arrangement; the
furniture of the room was old and rickety; the doors of the bookcase
were rotting in their hinges; the dust flew out from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
carpet in little clouds at every step; the blinds were yellow with
age and dirt; the state of everything in the room showed, with
a clearness not to be mistaken, that Mr. Serjeant Snubbin was
far too much occupied with his professional pursuits to take any
great heed or regard of his personal comforts.</p>

<p>The Serjeant was writing when his clients entered; he bowed
abstractedly when Mr. Pickwick was introduced by his solicitor;
and then, motioning them to a seat, put his pen carefully in the
inkstand, nursed his left leg, and waited to be spoken to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pickwick is the defendant in Bardell and Pickwick,
Serjeant Snubbin,&rdquo; said Perker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am retained in that, am I?&rdquo; said the Serjeant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are, sir,&rdquo; replied Perker.</p>

<p>The Serjeant nodded his head, and waited for something else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pickwick was anxious to call upon you, Serjeant Snubbin,&rdquo;
said Perker, &ldquo;to state to you, before you entered upon the case,
that he denies there being any ground or pretence whatever for the
action against him; and that unless he came into court with clean
hands, and without the most conscientious conviction that he was
right in resisting the plaintiff&rsquo;s demand, he would not be there at
all. I believe I state your views correctly; do not, my dear sir?&rdquo;
said the little man, turning to Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; replied that gentleman.</p>

<p>Mr. Serjeant Snubbin unfolded his glasses, raised them to his
eyes; and, after looking at Mr. Pickwick for a few seconds with
great curiosity, turned to Mr. Perker, and said, smiling slightly as
he spoke:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has Mr. Pickwick a strong case?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The attorney shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you propose calling witnesses?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The smile on the Serjeant&rsquo;s countenance became more defined;
he rocked his leg with increased violence; and, throwing himself
back in his easy-chair, coughed dubiously.</p>

<p>These tokens of the Serjeant&rsquo;s presentiments on the subject,
slight as they were, were not lost on Mr. Pickwick. He settled
the spectacles, through which he had attentively regarded such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
demonstrations of the barrister&rsquo;s feelings as he had permitted
himself to exhibit, more firmly on his nose; and said with great
energy, and in utter disregard of all Mr. Perker&rsquo;s admonitory
winkings and frownings:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My wishing to wait upon you, for such a purpose as this,
sir, appears, I have no doubt, to a gentleman who sees so much
of these matters as you must necessarily do, a very extraordinary
circumstance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Serjeant tried to look gravely at the fire, but the smile
came back again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen of your profession, sir,&rdquo; continued Mr. Pickwick,
&ldquo;see the worst side of human nature. All its disputes, all its ill-will
and bad blood, rise up before you. You know from your
experience of juries (I mean no disparagement to you, or them)
how much depends upon <em>effect</em>: and you are apt to attribute to
others, a desire to use, for purposes of deception and self-interest,
the very instruments which you, in pure honesty and honour of
purpose, and with a laudable desire to do your utmost for your
client, know the temper and worth of so well, from constantly
employing them yourselves. I really believe that to this circumstance
may be attributed the vulgar but very general notion of
your being, as a body, suspicious, distrustful, and over-cautious.
Conscious as I am, sir, of the disadvantage of making such a declaration
to you, under such circumstances, I have come here, because
I wish you distinctly to understand, as my friend Mr. Perker has
said, that I am innocent of the falsehood laid to my charge; and
although I am very well aware of the inestimable value of your
assistance, sir, I must beg to add, that unless you sincerely believe
this, I would rather be deprived of the aid of your talents than
have the advantage of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Long before the close of this address, which we are bound to
say was of a very prosy character for Mr. Pickwick, the Serjeant
had relapsed into a state of abstraction. After some minutes,
however, during which he had reassumed his pen, he appeared to
be again aware of the presence of his clients; raising his head
from the paper, he said, rather snappishly,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is with me in this case?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Phunky, Serjeant Snubbin,&rdquo; replied the attorney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Phunky, Phunky,&rdquo; said the Serjeant, &ldquo;I never heard the name
before. He must be a very young man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is a very young man,&rdquo; replied the attorney. &ldquo;He
was only called the other day. Let me see&mdash;he has not been at the
Bar eight years yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I thought not,&rdquo; said the Serjeant, in that sort of pitying
tone in which ordinary folks would speak of a very helpless little
child. &ldquo;Mr. Mallard, send round to Mr.&mdash;<span class="nobreak">Mr.&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Phunky&rsquo;s&mdash;Holborn Court, Gray&rsquo;s Inn,&rdquo; interposed Perker.
(Holborn Court, by-the-bye, is South Square now). &ldquo;Mr. Phunky,
and say I should be glad if he&rsquo;d step here, a moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Mallard departed to execute his commission; and Serjeant
Snubbin relapsed into abstraction until Mr. Phunky himself was
introduced.</p>

<p>Although an infant barrister, he was a full-grown man. He had
a very nervous manner, and a painful hesitation in his speech; it
did not appear to be a natural defect, but seemed rather the result
of timidity, arising from the consciousness of being &ldquo;kept down&rdquo;
by want of means, or interests, or connection, or impudence, as the
case might be. He was overawed by the Serjeant, and profoundly
courteous to the attorney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not had the pleasure of seeing you before, Mr. Phunky,&rdquo;
said Serjeant Snubbin, with a haughty condescension.</p>

<p>Mr. Phunky bowed. He <em>had</em> had the pleasure of seeing the
Serjeant, and of envying him too, with all a poor man&rsquo;s envy, for
eight years and a quarter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are with me in this case, I understand?&rdquo; said the
Serjeant.</p>

<p>If Mr. Phunky had been a rich man, he would have instantly
sent for his clerk to remind him; if he had been a wise one, he
would have applied his forefinger to his forehead, and endeavoured
to recollect, whether, in the multiplicity of his engagements, he
had undertaken this one, or not; but as he was neither rich nor
wise (in this sense at all events) he turned red, and bowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you read the papers, Mr. Phunky?&rdquo; inquired the
Serjeant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>Here again, Mr. Phunky should have professed to have forgotten
all about the merits of the case; but as he had read such papers
as had been laid before him in the course of the action, and had
thought of nothing else, waking, or sleeping, throughout the two
months during which he had been retained as Mr. Serjeant Snubbin&rsquo;s
junior, he turned a deeper red, and bowed again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Mr. Pickwick,&rdquo; said the Serjeant, waving his pen in
the direction in which that gentleman was standing.</p>

<p>Mr. Phunky bowed to Mr. Pickwick with a reverence which a
first client must ever awaken; and again inclined his head towards
his leader.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you will take Mr. Pickwick away,&rdquo; said the Serjeant,
&ldquo;and&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;hear anything Mr. Pickwick may wish to communicate.
We shall have a consultation, of course.&rdquo; With this
hint that he had been interrupted quite long enough, Mr. Serjeant
Snubbin, who had been gradually growing more and more abstracted,
applied his glass to his eyes for an instant, bowed slightly
round, and was once more deeply immersed in the case before him:
which arose out of an interminable lawsuit, originating in the act
of an individual, deceased a century or so ago, who had stopped
up a pathway leading from some place which nobody ever came
from, to some other place which nobody ever went to.</p>

<p>Mr. Phunky would not hear of passing through any door until
Mr. Pickwick and his solicitor had passed through before him, so
it was some time before they got into the Square; and when they
did reach it, they walked up and down, and held a long conference,
the result of which was, that it was a very difficult matter to say
how the verdict would go; that nobody could presume to calculate
on the issue of an action; that it was very lucky they had prevented
the other party from getting Serjeant Snubbin; and other
topics of doubt and consolation, common in such a position of
affairs.</p>

<p>Mr. Weller was then roused by his master from a sweet sleep of
an hour&rsquo;s duration; and, bidding adieu to Lowten, they returned
to the City.</p>

<p class="cap pd05"><span class="upper">There</span> is a repose about Lant Street, in the Borough,
which sheds a gentle melancholy upon the soul.
There are always a good many houses to let in the
street: it is a by-street too, and its dulness is
soothing. A house in Lant Street would not come
within the denomination of a first-rate residence, in
the strict acceptation of the term; but it is a most desirable spot
nevertheless. If a man wished to abstract himself from the world&mdash;to
remove himself from within the reach of temptation&mdash;to
place himself beyond the possibility of any inducement to look
out of the window&mdash;he should by all means go to Lant Street.</p>

<p>In this happy retreat are colonised a few clear-starchers, a
sprinkling of journeymen bookbinders, one or two prison agents
for the Insolvent Court, several small housekeepers who are employed
in the docks, a handful of mantua-makers, and a seasoning
of jobbing tailors. The majority of the inhabitants either direct
their energies to the letting of furnished apartments, or devote
themselves to the healthful and invigorating pursuit of mangling.
The chief features in the still life of the street are green shutters,
lodging-bills, brass door-plates, and bell-handles; the principal
specimens of animated nature, the pot-boy, the muffin youth, and
the baked-potato man. The population is migratory, usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
disappearing on the verge of quarter-day, and generally by night.
His Majesty&rsquo;s revenues are seldom collected in this happy valley;
the rents are dubious; and the water communication is very
frequently cut off.</p>

<p>Mr. Bob Sawyer embellished one side of the fire, in his first-floor
front, early in the evening for which he had invited Mr.
Pickwick; and Mr. Ben Allen the other. The preparations for
the reception of visitors appeared to be completed. The umbrellas
in the passage had been heaped into the little corner outside the
back-parlour door; the bonnet and shawl of the landlady&rsquo;s servant
had been removed from the banisters; there were not more than
two pairs of pattens on the street-door mat, and the kitchen candle,
with a very long snuff, burnt cheerfully on the ledge of the staircase
window. Mr. Bob Sawyer had himself purchased the spirits
at a wine vaults in High Street, and had returned home preceding
the bearer thereof, to preclude the possibility of their delivery at
the wrong house. The punch was ready-made in a red pan in the
bedroom; a little table, covered with a green baize cloth, had
been borrowed from the parlour, to play cards on; and the glasses
of the establishment, together with those which had been borrowed
for the occasion from the public-house, were all drawn up in a tray,
which was deposited on the landing outside the door.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the highly satisfactory nature of all these
arrangements, there was a cloud on the countenance of Mr. Bob
Sawyer, as he sat by the fireside. There was a sympathising
expression, too, in the features of Mr. Ben Allen, as he gazed
intently on the coals; and a tone of melancholy in his voice, as he
said, after a long silence:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it <em>is</em> unlucky she should have taken it in her head to
turn sour, just on this occasion. She might at least have waited
till to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s her malevolence, that&rsquo;s her malevolence,&rdquo; returned
Mr. Bob Sawyer, vehemently. &ldquo;She says that if I can afford to
give a party I ought to be able to pay her confounded &lsquo;little bill.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long has it been running?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Ben Allen.
A bill, by-the-bye, is the most extraordinary locomotive engine
that the genius of man ever produced. It would keep on running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
during the longest lifetime, without ever once stopping of its own
accord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only a quarter, and a month or so,&rdquo; replied Mr. Bob Sawyer.</p>

<p>Ben Allen coughed hopelessly, and directed a searching look
between the two top bars of the stove.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a deuced unpleasant thing if she takes it into her head
to let out, when those fellows are here, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Mr. Ben
Allen at length.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Horrible,&rdquo; replied Bob Sawyer, &ldquo;horrible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A low tap was heard at the room door. Mr. Bob Sawyer
looked expressively at his friend, and bade the tapper come in;
whereupon a dirty slipshod girl in black cotton stockings, who
might have passed for the neglected daughter of a superannuated
dustman in very reduced circumstances, thrust in her head, and
said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, Mister Sawyer, Missis Raddle wants to speak to <em>you</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before Mr. Bob Sawyer could return any answer, the girl
suddenly disappeared with a jerk, as if somebody had given her
a violent pull behind; this mysterious exit was no sooner accomplished,
than there was another tap at the door&mdash;a smart pointed
tap, which seemed to say, &ldquo;Here I am, and in I&rsquo;m coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Bob Sawyer glanced at his friend with a look of abject
apprehension, and once more cried &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The permission was not at all necessary, for, before Mr. Bob
Sawyer had uttered the words, a little fierce woman bounced into
the room, all in a tremble with passion, and pale with rage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Sawyer,&rdquo; said the little fierce woman, trying to
appear very calm, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll have the kindness to settle that little
bill of mine I&rsquo;ll thank you, because I&rsquo;ve got my rent to pay this
afternoon, and my landlord&rsquo;s a waiting below now.&rdquo; Here the
little woman rubbed her hands, and looked steadily over Mr. Bob
Sawyer&rsquo;s head, at the wall behind him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry to put you to any inconvenience, Mrs. Raddle,&rdquo;
said Bob Sawyer, deferentially, <span class="nobreak">&ldquo;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t any inconvenience,&rdquo; replied the little woman, with
a shrill titter. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want it particular before to-day; leastways,
as it has to go to my landlord directly, it was as well for you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
to keep it as me. You promised me this afternoon, Mr. Sawyer,
and every gentleman as has ever lived here, has kept his word, sir,
as of course anybody as calls himself a gentleman, does.&rdquo; Mrs.
Raddle tossed her head, bit her lips, rubbed her hands harder, and
looked at the wall more steadily than ever. It was plain to see, as
Mr. Bob Sawyer remarked in a style of eastern allegory on a subsequent
occasion, that she was &ldquo;getting the steam up.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="ill03"></a>
<img src="images/ill03.png" width="388" height="452" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll have the kindness to settle that little bill of mine
I&rsquo;ll thank you&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry, Mrs. Raddle,&rdquo; said Bob Sawyer with all
imaginable humility, &ldquo;but the fact is that I have been disappointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
in the City to-day.&rdquo;&mdash;Extraordinary place, that City. An astonishing
number of men always <em>are</em> getting disappointed there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Sawyer,&rdquo; said Mrs. Raddle, planting herself firmly
on a purple cauliflower in the Kidderminster carpet, &ldquo;and what&rsquo;s
that to me, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I have no doubt, Mrs. Raddle,&rdquo; said Bob Sawyer, blinking
this last question, &ldquo;that before the middle of next week we shall
be able to set ourselves quite square, and go on, on a better system
afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was all Mrs. Raddle wanted. She had bustled up to the
apartment of the unlucky Bob Sawyer, so bent upon going into
a passion, that in all probability payment would have rather
disappointed her than otherwise. She was in excellent order for a
little relaxation of the kind: having just exchanged a few introductory
compliments with Mr. R. in the front kitchen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose, Mr. Sawyer,&rdquo; said Mrs. Raddle, elevating
her voice for the information of the neighbours, &ldquo;do you suppose
that I&rsquo;m a-going day after day to let a fellar occupy my lodgings as
never thinks of paying his rent, nor even the very money laid out
for the fresh butter and lump sugar that&rsquo;s bought for his breakfast,
and the very milk that&rsquo;s took in, at the street door? Do you
suppose a hard-working and industrious woman as has lived in this
street for twenty year (ten year over the way, and nine year and
three-quarter in this very house) has nothing else to do but to work
herself to death after a parcel of lazy idle fellars, that are always
smoking and drinking, and lounging, when they ought to be glad
to turn their hands to anything that would help them to pay their
bills? Do <span class="nobreak">you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My good soul,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Benjamin Allen, soothingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have the goodness to keep your observashuns to yourself, sir,
I beg,&rdquo; said Mrs. Raddle, suddenly arresting the rapid torrent of
her speech, and addressing the third party with impressive slowness
and solemnity. &ldquo;I am not aweer, sir, that you have any right to
address your conversation to me. I don&rsquo;t think I let these apartments
to you, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you certainly did not,&rdquo; said Mr. Benjamin Allen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; responded Mrs. Raddle, with lofty politeness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
&ldquo;Then p&rsquo;raps, sir, you&rsquo;ll confine yourself to breaking the arms and
legs of the poor people in the hospitals, and keep yourself <em>to</em> yourself,
sir, or there may be some persons here as will make you, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you are such an unreasonable woman,&rdquo; remonstrated Mr.
Benjamin Allen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your parding, young man,&rdquo; said Mrs. Raddle, in a cold
perspiration of anger. &ldquo;But will you have the goodness just to
call me that again, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t make use of the word in any invidious sense, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo;
replied Mr. Benjamin Allen, growing somewhat uneasy on his own
account.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your parding, young man,&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Raddle in a
louder and more imperative tone. &ldquo;But who do you call a woman?
Did you make that remark to me, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, bless my heart!&rdquo; said Mr. Benjamin Allen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you apply that name to me, I ask of you, sir?&rdquo; interrupted
Mrs. Raddle, with intense fierceness, throwing the door
wide open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course I did,&rdquo; replied Mr. Benjamin Allen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course you did,&rdquo; said Mrs. Raddle, backing gradually
to the door, and raising her voice to its loudest pitch, for the special
behoof of Mr. Raddle in the kitchen. &ldquo;Yes, of course you did!
And everybody knows that they may safely insult me in my own
&rsquo;ouse while my husband sits sleeping down-stairs, and taking no
more notice than if I was a dog in the streets. He ought to be
ashamed of himself (here Mrs. Raddle sobbed) to allow his wife to
be treated in this way by a parcel of young cutters and carvers of
live people&rsquo;s bodies, that disgraces the lodgings (another sob), and
leaving her exposed to all manner of abuse; a base, faint-hearted,
timorous wretch, that&rsquo;s afraid to come up-stairs, and face the ruffinly
creatures&mdash;that&rsquo;s afraid&mdash;that&rsquo;s afraid to come!&rdquo; Mrs. Raddle
paused to listen whether the repetition of the taunt had roused her
better half; and, finding that it had not been successful, proceeded
to descend the stairs with sobs innumerable: when there came a
loud double knock at the street door: whereupon she burst into an
hysterical fit of weeping, accompanied with dismal moans, which
was prolonged until the knock had been repeated six times, when,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
in an uncontrollable burst of mental agony, she threw down all the
umbrellas, and disappeared into the back parlour, closing the door
after her with an awful crash.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does Mr. Sawyer live here?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, when the
door was opened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;first floor. It&rsquo;s the door straight afore
you when you gets to the top of the stairs.&rdquo; Having given this
instruction, the handmaid, who had been brought up among the
aboriginal inhabitants of Southwark, disappeared, with the candle
in her hand, down the kitchen stairs: perfectly satisfied that she
had done everything that could possibly be required of her under
the circumstances.</p>

<p>Mr. Snodgrass, who entered last, secured the street door, after
several ineffectual efforts, by putting up the chain; and the friends
stumbled up-stairs, where they were received by Mr. Bob Sawyer,
who had been afraid to go down, lest he should be waylaid by
Mrs. Raddle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; said the discomfited student. &ldquo;Glad to see
you,&mdash;take care of the glasses.&rdquo; This caution was addressed to
Mr. Pickwick, who had put his hat in the tray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;I beg your pardon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it, don&rsquo;t mention it,&rdquo; said Bob Sawyer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
rather confined for room here, but you must put up with all that,
when you come to see a young bachelor. Walk in. You&rsquo;ve seen
this gentleman before, I think?&rdquo; Mr. Pickwick shook hands with
Mr. Benjamin Allen, and his friends followed his example. They
had scarcely taken their seats when there was another double
knock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope that&rsquo;s Jack Hopkins!&rdquo; said Mr. Bob Sawyer. &ldquo;Hush!
Yes, it is. Come up, Jack; come up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A heavy footstep was heard upon the stairs, and Jack Hopkins
presented himself. He wore a black velvet waistcoat, with thunder-and-lightning
buttons; and a blue striped shirt, with a white false
collar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re late, Jack,&rdquo; said Mr. Benjamin Allen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Been detained at Bartholomew&rsquo;s,&rdquo; replied Hopkins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything new?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, nothing particular. Rather a good accident brought into
the casualty ward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was that, sir?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only a man fallen out of a four pair of stairs&rsquo; window;&mdash;but
it&rsquo;s a very fair case&mdash;very fair case indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that the patient is in a fair way to recover?&rdquo;
inquired Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Hopkins, carelessly. &ldquo;No, I should rather say
he wouldn&rsquo;t. There must be a splendid operation though, to-morrow&mdash;magnificent
sight if Slasher does it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You consider Mr. Slasher a good operator?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Best alive,&rdquo; replied Hopkins. &ldquo;Took a boy&rsquo;s leg out of the
socket last week&mdash;boy ate five apples and a gingerbread cake&mdash;exactly
two minutes after it was all over, boy said he wouldn&rsquo;t lie
there to be made game of, and he&rsquo;d tell his mother if they didn&rsquo;t
begin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, astonished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh! That&rsquo;s nothing, that ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Jack Hopkins. &ldquo;Is
it, Bob?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all,&rdquo; replied Mr. Bob Sawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By-the-bye, Bob,&rdquo; said Hopkins, with a scarcely perceptible
glance at Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s attentive face, &ldquo;we had a curious accident
last night. A child was brought in, who had swallowed a necklace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Swallowed what, sir?&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A necklace,&rdquo; replied Jack Hopkins. &ldquo;Not all at once, you
know, that would be too much&mdash;<em>you</em> couldn&rsquo;t swallow that, if the
child did&mdash;eh, Mr. Pickwick, ha! ha!&rdquo; Mr. Hopkins appeared
highly gratified with his own pleasantry; and continued. &ldquo;No,
the way was this. Child&rsquo;s parents were poor people who lived in a
court. Child&rsquo;s eldest sister bought a necklace; common necklace,
made of large black wooden beads. Child, being fond of toys,
cribbed the necklace, hid it, played with it, cut the string, and
swallowed a bead. Child thought it capital fun, went back next
day, and swallowed another bead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless my heart,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;what a dreadful thing!
I beg your pardon, sir. Go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Next day child swallowed two beads; the day after that, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
treated himself to three, and so on, till in a week&rsquo;s time he had got
through the necklace&mdash;five-and-twenty beads in all. The sister,
who was an industrious girl, and seldom treated herself to a bit of
finery, cried her eyes out, at the loss of the necklace; looked high
and low for it; but, I needn&rsquo;t say, didn&rsquo;t find it. A few days
afterwards the family were at dinner&mdash;baked shoulder of mutton,
and potatoes under it&mdash;the child, who wasn&rsquo;t hungry, was playing
about the room, when suddenly there was heard a devil of a noise,
like a small hailstorm. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t do that, my boy,&rsquo; said the father.
&lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t a doin&rsquo; nothing,&rsquo; said the child. &lsquo;Well, don&rsquo;t do it
again,&rsquo; said the father. There was a short silence, and then the
noise again began, worse than ever. &lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind what I say,
my boy,&rsquo; said the father, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll find yourself in bed, in something
less than a pig&rsquo;s whisper.&rsquo; He gave the child a shake to make him
obedient, and such a rattling ensued as nobody ever heard before.
&lsquo;Why, damme, it&rsquo;s <em>in</em> the child!&rsquo; said the father, &lsquo;he&rsquo;s got the
croup in the wrong place!&rsquo; &lsquo;No I haven&rsquo;t, father,&rsquo; said the child,
beginning to cry, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s the necklace; I swallowed it, father.&rsquo; The
father caught the child up, and ran with him to the hospital: the
beads in the boy&rsquo;s stomach rattling all the way with the jolting;
and the people looking up in the air, and down in the cellars to see
where the unusual sound came from. He&rsquo;s in the hospital now,&rdquo;
said Jack Hopkins, &ldquo;and he makes such a devil of a noise when he
walks about, that they&rsquo;re obliged to muffle him in a watchman&rsquo;s
coat, for fear he should wake the patients!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the most extraordinary case I ever heard of,&rdquo; said Mr.
Pickwick, with an emphatic blow on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; said Jack Hopkins; &ldquo;is it, Bob?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; replied Mr. Bob Sawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very singular things occur in our profession, I can assure you,
sir,&rdquo; said Hopkins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I should be disposed to imagine,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>Another knock at the door, announced a large-headed young
man in a black wig, who brought with him a scorbutic youth in a
long stock. The next comer was a gentleman in a shirt emblazoned
with pink anchors, who was closely followed by a pale youth with
a plated watchguard. The arrival of a prim personage in clean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
linen and cloth boots rendered the party complete. The little table
with the green baize cover was wheeled out; the first instalment of
punch was brought in, in a white jug; and the succeeding three
hours were devoted to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vingt-et-un</i> at sixpence a dozen, which was
only once interrupted by a slight dispute between the scorbutic
youth and the gentleman with the pink anchors; in the course of
which, the scorbutic youth intimated a burning desire to pull the
nose of the gentleman with the emblems of hope; in reply to
which, that individual expressed his decided unwillingness to accept
of any &ldquo;sauce&rdquo; on gratuitous terms, either from the irascible young
gentleman with the scorbutic countenance, or any other person
who was ornamented with a head.</p>

<p>When the last &ldquo;natural&rdquo; had been declared, and the profit
and loss account of fish and sixpences adjusted, to the satisfaction
of all parties, Mr. Bob Sawyer rang for supper, and the visitors
squeezed themselves into corners while it was getting ready.</p>

<p>It was not so easily got ready as some people may imagine.
First of all, it was necessary to awaken the girl, who had fallen
asleep with her face on the kitchen table; this took a little time,
and, even when she did answer the bell, another quarter of an hour
was consumed in fruitless endeavours to impart to her a faint and
distant glimmering of reason. The man to whom the order for the
oysters had been sent, had not been told to open them; it is a very
difficult thing to open an oyster with a limp knife or a two-pronged
fork; and very little was done in this way. Very little of the beef
was done either; and the ham (which was also from the German-sausage
shop round the corner) was in a similar predicament.
However, there was plenty of porter in a tin can; and the cheese
went a great way, for it was very strong. So upon the whole,
perhaps, the supper was quite as good as such matters usually are.</p>

<p>After supper, another jug of punch was put upon the table,
together with a paper of cigars, and a couple of bottles of spirits.
Then there was an awful pause; and this awful pause was occasioned
by a very common occurrence in this sort of place, but a very
embarrassing one notwithstanding.</p>

<p>The fact is, the girl was washing the glasses. The establishment
boasted four; we do not record the circumstance as at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
derogatory to Mrs. Raddle, for there never was a lodging-house yet,
that was not short of glasses. The landlady&rsquo;s glasses were little
thin blown glass tumblers, and those which had been borrowed from
the public-house were great, dropsical, bloated articles, each supported
on a huge gouty leg. This would have been in itself
sufficient to have possessed the company with the real state of
affairs; but the young woman of all work had prevented the possibility
of any misconception arising in the mind of any gentleman
upon the subject, by forcibly dragging every man&rsquo;s glass away, long
before he had finished his beer, and audibly stating, despite the
winks and interruptions of Mr. Bob Sawyer, that it was to be
conveyed down-stairs, and washed forthwith.</p>

<p>It is a very ill wind that blows nobody any good. The prim
man in the cloth boots, who had been unsuccessfully attempting to
make a joke during the whole time the round game lasted, saw his
opportunity, and availed himself of it. The instant the glasses
disappeared, he commenced a long story about a great public
character, whose name he had forgotten, making a particularly
happy reply to another eminent and illustrious individual whom he
had never been able to identify. He enlarged at some length and
with great minuteness upon divers collateral circumstances, distantly
connected with the anecdote in hand, but for the life of him he
couldn&rsquo;t recollect at that precise moment what the anecdote was,
although he had been in the habit of telling the story with great
applause for the last ten years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said the prim man in the cloth boots, &ldquo;it is a very
extraordinary circumstance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry you have forgotten it,&rdquo; said Mr. Bob Sawyer,
glancing eagerly at the door, as he thought he heard the noise of
glasses jingling; &ldquo;very sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; responded the prim man, &ldquo;because I know it
would have afforded so much amusement. Never mind; I dare
say I shall manage to recollect it, in the course of half an hour
or so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prim man arrived at this point, just as the glasses came
back, when Mr. Bob Sawyer, who had been absorbed in attention
during the whole time, said he should very much like to hear the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
end of it, for, so far as it went, it was, without exception, the very
best story he had ever heard.</p>

<p>The sight of the tumblers restored Bob Sawyer to a degree of
equanimity which he had not possessed since his interview with his
landlady. His face brightened up, and he began to feel quite
convivial.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Betsy,&rdquo; said Mr. Bob Sawyer, with great suavity, and
dispersing, at the same time, the tumultuous little mob of glasses
the girl had collected in the centre of the table: &ldquo;now, Betsy, the
warm water: be brisk, there&rsquo;s a good girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have no warm water,&rdquo; replied Betsy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No warm water!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Bob Sawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the girl, with a shake of the head which expressed
a more decided negative than the most copious language could
have conveyed. &ldquo;Missis Raddle said you warn&rsquo;t to have none.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The surprise depicted on the countenances of his guests imparted
new courage to the host.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring up the warm water instantly&mdash;instantly!&rdquo; said Mr.
Bob Sawyer, with desperate sternness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied the girl; &ldquo;Missis Raddle raked out
the kitchen fire afore she went to bed, and locked up the kittle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, never mind; never mind. Pray don&rsquo;t disturb yourself
about such a trifle,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, observing the conflict of
Bob Sawyer&rsquo;s passions, as depicted in his countenance, &ldquo;cold water
will do very well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, admirably,&rdquo; said Mr. Benjamin Allen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My landlady is subject to some slight attacks of mental
derangement,&rdquo; remarked Bob Sawyer with a ghastly smile; &ldquo;and
I fear I must give her warning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Ben Allen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear I must,&rdquo; said Bob, with heroic firmness. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay her
what I owe her, and give her warning to-morrow morning.&rdquo; Poor
fellow! how devoutly he wished he could!</p>

<p>Mr. Bob Sawyer&rsquo;s heart-sickening attempts to rally under this
last blow, communicated a dispiriting influence on the company, the
greater part of whom, with the view of raising their spirits, attached
themselves with extra cordiality to the cold brandy and water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the first perceptible effects of which were displayed in a renewal
of hostilities between the scorbutic youth and the gentleman in
the shirt. The belligerents vented their feelings of mutual contempt,
for some time, in a variety of frownings and snortings, until
at last the scorbutic youth felt it necessary to come to a more
explicit understanding on the matter, when the following clear
understanding took place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sawyer,&rdquo; said the scorbutic youth, in a loud voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Noddy,&rdquo; replied Mr. Bob Sawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should be very sorry, Sawyer,&rdquo; said Mr. Noddy, &ldquo;to create
any unpleasantness at any friend&rsquo;s table, and much less at yours,
Sawyer&mdash;very; but I must take this opportunity of informing
Mr. Gunter that he is no gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And <em>I</em> should be very sorry, Sawyer, to create any disturbance
in the street in which you reside,&rdquo; said Mr. Gunter, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m
afraid I shall be under the necessity of alarming the neighbours by
throwing the person who has just spoken, out o&rsquo; window.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that, sir?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Noddy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I say, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Gunter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to see you do it, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Noddy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall feel me do it in half a minute, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Gunter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I request that you&rsquo;ll favour me with your card, sir,&rdquo; said Mr.
Noddy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do nothing of the kind, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Gunter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not, sir?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Noddy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;ll stick it up over your chimney-piece, and delude
your visitors into the false belief that a gentleman has been to see
you, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Gunter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir, a friend of mine shall wait on you in the morning,&rdquo; said
Mr. Noddy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir, I&rsquo;m very much obliged to you for the caution, and I&rsquo;ll
leave particular directions with the servant to lock up the spoons,&rdquo;
replied Mr. Gunter.</p>

<p>At this point the remainder of the guests interposed, and
remonstrated with both parties on the impropriety of their conduct;
on which Mr. Noddy begged to state that his father was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
quite as respectable as Mr. Gunter&rsquo;s father; to which Mr. Gunter
replied that his father was to the full as respectable as Mr. Noddy&rsquo;s
father, and that his father&rsquo;s son was as good a man as Mr. Noddy,
any day in the week. As this announcement seemed the prelude to
a recommencement of the dispute, there was another interference
on the part of the company; and a vast quantity of talking and
clamouring ensued, in the course of which Mr. Noddy gradually
allowed his feelings to overpower him, and professed that he had
ever entertained a devoted personal attachment towards Mr.
Gunter. To this Mr. Gunter replied that, upon the whole, he
rather preferred Mr. Noddy to his own brother; on hearing which
admission, Mr. Noddy magnanimously rose from his seat, and
proffered his hand to Mr. Gunter. Mr. Gunter grasped it with
affecting fervour; and everybody said that the whole dispute had
been conducted in a manner which was highly honourable to both
parties concerned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Jack Hopkins, &ldquo;just to set us going again, Bob,
I don&rsquo;t mind singing a song.&rdquo; And Hopkins, incited thereto by
tumultuous applause, plunged himself at once into &ldquo;The King,
God bless him,&rdquo; which he sang as loud as he could, to a novel air,
compounded of the &ldquo;Bay of Biscay,&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Frog he would.&rdquo;
The chorus was the essence of the song; and, as each gentleman
sang it to the tune he knew best, the effect was very striking
indeed.</p>

<p>It was at the end of the chorus to the first verse, that Mr.
Pickwick held up his hand in a listening attitude, and said, as soon
as silence was restored:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush! I beg your pardon. I thought I heard somebody
calling from up-stairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A profound silence immediately ensued; and Mr. Bob Sawyer
was observed to turn pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I hear it now,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;Have the goodness
to open the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door was no sooner opened than all doubt on the subject
was removed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Sawyer! Mr. Sawyer!&rdquo; screamed a voice from the two-pair
landing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my landlady,&rdquo; said Bob Sawyer, looking round him with
great dismay. &ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Raddle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by this, Mr. Sawyer?&rdquo; replied the voice,
with great shrillness and rapidity of utterance. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it enough
to be swindled out of one&rsquo;s rent, and money lent out of pocket
besides, and abused and insulted by your friends that dares to
call themselves men: without having the house turned out of
window, and noise enough made to bring the fire-engines here, at
two o&rsquo;clock in the morning? Turn them wretches away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to be ashamed of yourselves,&rdquo; said the voice of
Mr. Raddle, which appeared to proceed from beneath some distant
bed-clothes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ashamed of themselves!&rdquo; said Mrs. Raddle. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t
you go down and knock &rsquo;em every one down-stairs? You would
if you was a man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should if I was a dozen men, my dear,&rdquo; replied Mr. Raddle,
pacifically, &ldquo;but they&rsquo;ve the advantage of me in numbers, my dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugh, you coward!&rdquo; replied Mrs. Raddle, with supreme contempt.
&ldquo;<em>Do</em> you mean to turn them wretches out, or not, Mr.
Sawyer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re going, Mrs. Raddle, they&rsquo;re going,&rdquo; said the miserable
Bob. &ldquo;I am afraid you&rsquo;d better go,&rdquo; said Mr. Bob Sawyer to his
friends. &ldquo;I <em>thought</em> you were making too much noise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very unfortunate thing,&rdquo; said the prim man. &ldquo;Just as
we were getting so comfortable too!&rdquo; The prim man was just
beginning to have a dawning recollection of the story he had
forgotten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hardly to be borne,&rdquo; said the prim man, looking round.
&ldquo;Hardly to be borne, is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not to be endured,&rdquo; replied Jack Hopkins; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s have the
other verse, Bob. Come, here goes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, Jack, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; interrupted Bob Sawyer; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a capital
song, but I am afraid we had better not have the other verse.
They are very violent people, the people of the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I step up-stairs and pitch into the landlord?&rdquo; inquired
Hopkins, &ldquo;or keep on ringing the bell, or go and groan on the
staircase? You may command me, Bob.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very much indebted to you for your friendship and good
nature, Hopkins,&rdquo; said the wretched Mr. Bob Sawyer, &ldquo;but I think,
the best plan to avoid any further dispute is for us to break up at
once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now Mr. Sawyer!&rdquo; screamed the shrill voice of Mrs. Raddle,
&ldquo;<em>are</em> them brutes going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re only looking for their hats, Mrs. Raddle,&rdquo; said Bob;
&ldquo;they are going directly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going!&rdquo; said Mrs. Raddle, thrusting her night-cap over the
banisters just as Mr. Pickwick, followed by Mr. Tupman, emerged
from the sitting-room. &ldquo;Going! what did they ever come for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; remonstrated Mr. Pickwick, looking up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get along with you, you old wretch!&rdquo; replied Mrs. Raddle,
hastily withdrawing the night-cap. &ldquo;Old enough to be his grandfather,
you willin! You&rsquo;re worse than any of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick found it in vain to protest his innocence, so hurried
down-stairs into the street, whither he was closely followed by Mr.
Tupman, Mr. Winkle, and Mr. Snodgrass. Mr. Ben Allen, who
was dismally depressed with spirits and agitation, accompanied
them as far as London Bridge, and in the course of the walk confided
to Mr. Winkle, as an especially eligible person to entrust the
secret to, that he was resolved to cut the throat of any gentleman
except Mr. Bob Sawyer, who should aspire to the affections of his
sister Arabella. Having expressed his determination to perform
this painful duty of a brother with proper firmness, he burst into
tears, knocked his hat over his eyes, and, making the best of his
way back, knocked double knocks at the door of the Borough
Market office, and took short naps on the steps alternately, until
daybreak, under the firm impression that he lived there, and had
forgotten the key.</p>

<p>The visitors having all departed, in compliance with the rather
pressing request of Mrs. Raddle, the luckless Mr. Bob Sawyer was
left alone to meditate on the probable events of to-morrow, and
the pleasures of the evening.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> morning of the thirteenth of February,
which the readers of this
authentic narrative know, as well as we do,
to have been the day immediately preceding
that which was appointed for the trial of Mrs.
Bardell&rsquo;s action, was a busy time for Mr.
Samuel Weller, who was perpetually engaged
in travelling from the George and Vulture
to Mr. Perker&rsquo;s chambers and back again, from and between
the hours of nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning and two in the afternoon,
both inclusive. Not that there was anything whatever to be
done, for the consultation had taken place, and the course of
proceeding to be adopted, had been finally determined on; but
Mr. Pickwick being in a most extreme state of excitement, persevered
in constantly sending small notes to his attorney, merely
containing the inquiry, &ldquo;Dear Perker. Is all going on well?&rdquo; to
which Mr. Perker invariably forwarded the reply, &ldquo;Dear Pickwick.
As well as possible;&rdquo; the fact being, as we have already hinted,
that there was nothing whatever to go on, either well or ill, until
the sitting of the court on the following morning.</p>

<p>But people who go voluntarily to law, or are taken forcibly there,
for the first time, may be allowed to labour under some temporary
irritation and anxiety: and Sam, with a due allowance for the
frailties of human nature, obeyed all his master&rsquo;s behests with that
imperturbable good humour and unruffable composure which
formed one of his most striking and amiable characteristics.</p>

<p>Sam had solaced himself with a most agreeable little dinner, and
was waiting at the bar for the glass of warm mixture in which Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Pickwick had requested him to drown the fatigues of his morning&rsquo;s
walks, when a young boy of about three feet high, or thereabouts,
in a hairy cap and fustian over-alls, whose garb bespoke a laudable
ambition to attain in time the elevation of an hostler, entered
the passage of the George and Vulture, and looked first up the
stairs, and then along the passage, and then into the bar, as if in
search of somebody to whom he bore a commission; whereupon the
barmaid, conceiving it not improbable that the said commission
might be directed to the tea or table spoons of the establishment,
accosted the boy with:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, young man, what do <em>you</em> want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there anybody here, named Sam?&rdquo; inquired the youth, in
a loud voice of treble quality.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="ill04"></a>
<img src="images/ill04.png" width="457" height="312" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>&ldquo;Is there anybody here, named Sam?&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the t&rsquo;other name?&rdquo; said Sam Weller, looking round.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; briskly replied the young gentleman
below the hairy cap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a sharp boy, you are,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller; &ldquo;only I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
wouldn&rsquo;t show that wery fine edge too much, if I was you, in case
anybody took it off. What do you mean by comin&rsquo; to a hot-el and
asking arter Sam, vith as much politeness as a vild Indian?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cos an old gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n told me to,&rdquo; replied the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What old gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n?&rdquo; inquired Sam, with deep disdain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Him as drives a Ipswich coach, and uses our parlour,&rdquo; rejoined
the boy. &ldquo;He told me yesterday mornin&rsquo; to come to the
George and Wultur this arternoon, and ask for Sam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my father, my dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, turning with an
explanatory air to the young lady in the bar; &ldquo;blessed if I think
he hardly knows wot my other name is. Vell, young brockiley
sprout, wot then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, then,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;you was to come to him at six
o&rsquo;clock to our &rsquo;ouse, &rsquo;cos he wants to see you&mdash;Blue Boar, Leaden&rsquo;all
Markit. Shall I say you&rsquo;re comin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You <em>may</em> wenture on that &rsquo;ere statement, sir,&rdquo; replied Sam.
And thus empowered, the young gentleman walked away, awakening
all the echoes in George Yard, as he did so, with several chaste and
extremely correct imitations of a drover&rsquo;s whistle, delivered in a
tone of peculiar richness and volume.</p>

<p>Mr. Weller having obtained leave of absence from Mr. Pickwick,
who, in his then state of excitement and worry was by no means
displeased at being left alone, set forth, long before the appointed
hour, and having plenty of time at his disposal, sauntered down as
far as the Mansion House, where he paused and contemplated, with
a face of great calmness and philosophy, the numerous cads and
drivers of short stages who assemble near that famous place of
resort, to the great terror and confusion of the old-lady population
of these realms. Having loitered here, for half an hour or so, Mr.
Weller turned, and began wending his way towards Leadenhall
Market, through a variety of by-streets and courts. As he was
sauntering away his spare time, and stopped to look at almost every
object that met his gaze, it is by no means surprising that Mr.
Weller should have paused before a small stationer&rsquo;s and print-seller&rsquo;s
window; but without further explanation it does appear
surprising that his eyes should have no sooner rested on certain
pictures which were exposed for sale therein, than he gave a sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
start, smote his right leg with great vehemence, and exclaimed with
energy, &ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for this, I should ha&rsquo; forgot all about it,
till it was too late!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The particular picture on which Sam Weller&rsquo;s eyes were fixed, as
he said this, was a highly coloured representation of a couple of
human hearts, skewered together with an arrow, cooking before a
cheerful fire, while a male and female cannibal in modern attire:
the gentleman being clad in a blue coat and white trousers, and the
lady in a deep red pelisse with a parasol of the same: were approaching
the meal with hungry eyes, up a serpentine gravel path
leading thereunto. A decidedly indelicate young gentleman, in a
pair of wings and nothing else, was depicted as superintending the
cooking; a representation of the spire of the church in Langham
Place, London, appeared in the distance; and the whole formed a
&ldquo;valentine,&rdquo; of which, as a written inscription in the window testified,
there was a large assortment within, which the shopkeeper
pledged himself to dispose of, to his countrymen generally, at the
reduced rate of one and sixpence each.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should ha&rsquo; forgot it; I should certainly ha&rsquo; forgot it!&rdquo; said
Sam; so saying, he at once stepped into the stationer&rsquo;s shop, and
requested to be served with a sheet of the best gilt-edged letter-paper,
and a hard-nibbed pen which could be warranted not to
splutter. These articles having been promptly supplied, he walked
on direct towards Leadenhall Market at a good round pace, very
different from his recent lingering one. Looking round him, he
there beheld a sign-board on which the painter&rsquo;s art had delineated
something remotely resembling a cerulean elephant with an
aquiline nose in lieu of trunk. Rightly conjecturing that this was
the Blue Boar himself, he stepped into the house, and inquired concerning
his parent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t be here this three-quarters of an hour or more,&rdquo; said
the young lady who superintended the domestic arrangements of
the Blue Boar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wery good, my dear,&rdquo; replied Sam. &ldquo;Let me have nine
penn&rsquo;orth o&rsquo; brandy and water luke, and the inkstand, will you,
miss?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The brandy and water luke, and the inkstand, having been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
carried into the little parlour, and the young lady having carefully
flattened down the coals to prevent their blazing, and carried away
the poker to preclude the possibility of the fire being stirred, without
the full privity and concurrence of the Blue Boar being first
had and obtained, Sam Weller sat himself down in a box near the
stove, and pulled out the sheet of gilt-edged letter-paper, and the
hard-nibbed pen. Then looking carefully at the pen to see that
there were no hairs in it, and dusting down the table, so that there
might be no crumbs of bread under the paper, Sam tucked up the
cuffs of his coat, squared his elbows, and composed himself to write.</p>

<p>To ladies and gentlemen who are not in the habit of devoting
themselves practically to the science of penmanship, writing a letter
is no very easy task; it being always considered necessary in such
cases for the writer to recline his head on his left arm, so as to
place his eyes as nearly as possible on a level with the paper, while
glancing sideways at the letters he is constructing, and to form with
his tongue imaginary characters to correspond. These motions,
although unquestionably of the greatest assistance to original composition,
retard in some degree the progress of the writer; and
Sam had unconsciously been a full hour and a half writing words
in small text, smearing out wrong letters with his little finger, and
putting in new ones which required going over often to render
them visible through the old blots, when he was roused by the
opening of the door and the entrance of his parent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vell, Sammy,&rdquo; said the father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vell, my Prooshan Blue,&rdquo; responded the son, laying down his
pen. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the last bulletin about mother-in-law?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mrs. Weller passed a very good night, but is uncommon perwerse
and unpleasant this mornin&rsquo;. Signed upon oath, S. Veller,
Esquire, Senior.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s the last vun as was issued, Sammy,&rdquo;
replied Mr. Weller, untying his shawl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No better yet?&rdquo; inquired Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the symptoms aggerawated,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller, shaking
his head. &ldquo;But wot&rsquo;s that, you&rsquo;re a doin&rsquo; of? Pursuit of knowledge
under difficulties, Sammy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done now,&rdquo; said Sam, with slight embarrassment; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been a writin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;So I see,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller. &ldquo;Not to any young &rsquo;ooman,
I hope, Sammy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why it&rsquo;s no use a sayin&rsquo; it ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Sam. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a walentine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A what!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Weller, apparently horror-stricken
by the word.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 624px;"><a id="color03"></a>
<img src="images/color03.jpg" width="624" height="460" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>&ldquo;A what!&rdquo; asked Mr. Weller,
apparently horror-stricken by
the word. &ldquo;A walentine,&rdquo;
replied Sam.</p>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;A walentine,&rdquo; replied Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Samivel, Samivel,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, in reproachful accents, &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; done it. Arter the warnin&rsquo; you&rsquo;ve had o&rsquo;
your father&rsquo;s wicious propensities; arter all I&rsquo;ve said to you upon
this here wery subject; arter actiwally seein&rsquo; and bein&rsquo; in the
company o&rsquo; your own mother-in-law, vich I should ha&rsquo; thought wos
a moral lesson as no man could never ha&rsquo; forgotten to his dyin&rsquo;
day! I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; done it, Sammy, I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d
ha&rsquo; done it!&rdquo; These reflections were too much for the good old
man. He raised Sam&rsquo;s tumbler to his lips and drank off its contents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nev&rsquo;r mind, Sammy,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll be a wery
agonizin&rsquo; trial to me at my time of life, but I&rsquo;m pretty tough, that&rsquo;s
vun consolation, as the wery old turkey remarked ven the farmer
said he wos afeerd he should be obliged to kill him for the London
market.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot&rsquo;ll be a trial?&rdquo; inquired Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To see you married, Sammy&mdash;to see you a dilluded wictim,
and thinkin&rsquo; in your innocence that it&rsquo;s all wery capital,&rdquo; replied
Mr. Weller. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dreadful trial to a father&rsquo;s feelin&rsquo;s, that &rsquo;ere,
Sammy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a goin&rsquo; to get married, don&rsquo;t
you fret yourself about that; I know you&rsquo;re a judge of these things.
Order in your pipe, and I&rsquo;ll read you the letter. There!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We cannot distinctly say whether it was the prospect of the
pipe, or the consolatory reflection that a fatal disposition to get
married ran in the family and couldn&rsquo;t be helped, which calmed
Mr. Weller&rsquo;s feelings, and caused his grief to subside. We should
be rather disposed to say that the result was attained by combining
the two sources of consolation, for he repeated the second in a low
tone, very frequently; ringing the bell meanwhile, to order in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
first. He then divested himself of his upper coat; and lighting
the pipe and placing himself in front of the fire with his back
towards it, so that he could feel its full heat, and recline against
the mantelpiece at the same time, turned towards Sam, and, with
a countenance greatly mollified by the softening influence of
tobacco, requested him to &ldquo;fire away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam dipped his pen into the ink to be ready for any corrections,
and began with a very theatrical air:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Lovely&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, ringing the bell. &ldquo;A double glass
o&rsquo; the inwariable, my dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; replied the girl; who with great quickness
appeared, vanished, returned, and disappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They seem to know your ways here,&rdquo; observed Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied his father, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been here before, in my time.
Go on, Sammy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Lovely creetur,&rsquo;&rdquo; repeated Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t in poetry, is it?&rdquo; interposed his father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wery glad to hear it,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller. &ldquo;Poetry&rsquo;s unnat&rsquo;ral;
no man ever talked poetry &rsquo;cept a beadle on boxin&rsquo; day, or Warren&rsquo;s
blackin&rsquo;, or Rowland&rsquo;s oil, or some o&rsquo; them low fellows; never
you let yourself down to talk poetry, my boy. Begin agin,
Sammy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Weller resumed his pipe with critical solemnity, and Sam
once more commenced, and read as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Lovely creetur i feel myself a damned&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t proper,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, taking his pipe from
his mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; it ain&rsquo;t &lsquo;damned,&rsquo;&rdquo; observed Sam, holding the letter up
to the light, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s &lsquo;shamed,&rsquo; there&rsquo;s a blot there&mdash;&lsquo;I feel myself
ashamed.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wery good,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller. &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Feel myself ashamed, and completely cir&mdash;&rsquo; I forget what
this here word is,&rdquo; said Sam, scratching his head with the pen, in
vain attempts to remember.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you look at it, then?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Weller.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;So I <em>am</em> a lookin&rsquo; at it,&rdquo; replied Sam, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s another
blot. Here&rsquo;s a &lsquo;c,&rsquo; and a &lsquo;i,&rsquo; and a &lsquo;d.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Circumwented, p&rsquo;raps,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it ain&rsquo;t that,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;circumscribed; that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t as good a word as circumwented, Sammy,&rdquo; said
Mr. Weller, gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think not?&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; like it,&rdquo; replied his father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you think it means more?&rdquo; inquired Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vell, p&rsquo;raps it is a more tenderer word,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, after
a moment&rsquo;s reflection. &ldquo;Go on, Sammy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Feel myself ashamed and completely circumscribed in a
dressin&rsquo; of you, for you <em>are</em> a nice gal and nothin&rsquo; but it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a wery pretty sentiment,&rdquo; said the elder Mr. Weller,
removing his pipe to make way for the remark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think it is rayther good,&rdquo; observed Sam, highly
flattered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot I like in that &rsquo;ere style of writin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said the elder Mr.
Weller, &ldquo;is that there ain&rsquo;t no callin&rsquo; names in it&mdash;no Wenuses,
nor nothin&rsquo; o&rsquo; that kind. Wot&rsquo;s the good o&rsquo; callin&rsquo; a young &rsquo;ooman
a Wenus or a angel, Sammy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! what, indeed?&rdquo; replied Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might jist as well call her a griffin, or a unicorn, or a
king&rsquo;s arms at once, which is wery well known to be a col-lection o&rsquo;
fabulous animals,&rdquo; added Mr. Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just as well,&rdquo; replied Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drive on, Sammy,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller.</p>

<p>Sam complied with the request, and proceeded as follows: his
father continuing to smoke, with a mixed expression of wisdom
and complacency, which was particularly edifying,</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Afore I see you, I thought all women was alike.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So they are,&rdquo; observed the elder Mr. Weller, parenthetically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But now,&rsquo; continued Sam, &lsquo;now I find what a reg&rsquo;lar soft-headed,
inkred&rsquo;lous turnip I must ha&rsquo; been; for there ain&rsquo;t nobody
like you, though <em>I</em> like you better than nothin&rsquo; at all.&rsquo; I thought it
best to make that rayther strong,&rdquo; said Sam, looking up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Weller nodded approvingly, and Sam resumed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So I take the privilidge of the day, Mary my dear&mdash;as the
gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n in difficulties did, ven he walked out of a Sunday&mdash;to
tell you that the first and only time I see you, your likeness was
took on my hart in much quicker time and brighter colours than
ever a likeness was took by the profeel macheen (vich p&rsquo;raps you
may have heerd on Mary my dear) altho it <em>does</em> finish a portrait
and put the frame and glass on complete, with a hook at the end
to hang it up by, and all in two minutes and a quarter.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afeerd that werges on the poetical, Sammy,&rdquo; said Mr.
Weller, dubiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No it don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Sam, reading on very quickly, to avoid
contesting the point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Except of me Mary my dear as your walentine and think
over what I&rsquo;ve said.&mdash;My dear Mary I will now conclude.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s
all,&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather a sudden pull up, ain&rsquo;t it, Sammy?&rdquo; inquired
Mr. Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit on it,&rdquo; said Sam; &ldquo;she&rsquo;ll vish there wos more, and
that&rsquo;s the great art o&rsquo; letter writin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; in that; and I wish
your mother-in-law &rsquo;ud only conduct her conwersation on the same
gen-teel principle. Ain&rsquo;t you a goin&rsquo; to sign it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the difficulty,&rdquo; said Sam; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what <em>to</em>
sign it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sign it, Veller,&rdquo; said the oldest surviving proprietor of that
name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;Never sign a walentine with your
own name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sign it &lsquo;Pickvick,&rsquo; then,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a wery good
name and an easy one to spell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wery thing,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;I <em>could</em> end with a werse; what
do you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it, Sam,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Weller. &ldquo;I never know&rsquo;d
a respectable coachman as wrote poetry, &rsquo;cept one, as made an
affectin&rsquo; copy o&rsquo; werses the night afore he wos hung for a highway
robbery; and <em>he</em> wos only a Cambervell man, so even that&rsquo;s no rule.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>But Sam was not to be dissuaded from the poetical idea that
had occurred to him, so he signed the letter,</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your love-sick<br />
Pickwick.&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p>And having folded it in a very intricate manner, squeezed a down-hill
direction in one corner: &ldquo;To Mary, Housemaid, at Mr.
Nupkins&rsquo;s Mayor&rsquo;s, Ipswich, Suffolk;&rdquo; and put it into his pocket,
wafered, and ready for the general post. This important business
having been transacted, Mr. Weller the elder proceeded to open
that on which he had summoned his son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first matter relates to your governor, Sammy,&rdquo; said Mr.
Weller. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a goin&rsquo; to be tried to-morrow, ain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The trial&rsquo;s a comin&rsquo; on,&rdquo; replied Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vell,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, &ldquo;now I s&rsquo;pose he&rsquo;ll want to call some
witnesses to speak to his character, or p&rsquo;raps to prove a alleybi.
I&rsquo;ve been a turnin&rsquo; the business over in my mind, and he may make
his-self easy, Sammy. I&rsquo;ve got some friends as&rsquo;ll do either for him,
but my adwice &rsquo;ud be this here&mdash;never mind the character, and
stick to the alleybi. Nothing like a alleybi, Sammy, nothing.&rdquo;
Mr. Weller looked very profound as he delivered this legal opinion;
and burying his nose in his tumbler, winked over the top thereof,
at his astonished son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what do you mean?&rdquo; said Sam; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s
a goin&rsquo; to be tried at the Old Bailey, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t no part of the present con-sideration, Sammy,&rdquo;
replied Mr. Weller. &ldquo;Verever he&rsquo;s a goin&rsquo; to be tried, my boy, a
alleybi&rsquo;s the thing to get him off. Ve got Tom Vildspark off that
&rsquo;ere manslaughter, with a alleybi, ven all the big vigs to a man said
as nothin&rsquo; couldn&rsquo;t save him. And my &rsquo;pinion is, Sammy, that if
your governor don&rsquo;t prove a alleybi, he&rsquo;ll be what the Italians call
reg&rsquo;larly flummoxed, and that&rsquo;s all about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the elder Mr. Weller entertained a firm and unalterable conviction
that the Old Bailey was the supreme court of judicature in
this country, and that its rules and forms of proceeding regulated
and controlled the practice of all other courts of justice whatsoever,
he totally disregarded the assurances and arguments of his son,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
tending to show that the alibi was inadmissible; and vehemently
protested that Mr. Pickwick was being &ldquo;wictimised.&rdquo; Finding that
it was of no use to discuss the matter further, Sam changed the
subject, and inquired what the second topic was, on which his
revered parent wished to consult him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pint o&rsquo; domestic policy, Sammy,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller.
&ldquo;This here <span class="nobreak">Stiggins&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Red-nosed man?&rdquo; inquired Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wery same,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller. &ldquo;This here red-nosed
man, Sammy, wisits your mother-in-law vith a kindness and
constancy as I never see equalled. He&rsquo;s sitch a friend o&rsquo; the
family, Sammy, that ven he&rsquo;s avay from us, he can&rsquo;t be comfortable
unless he has somethin&rsquo; to remember us by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;d give him somethin&rsquo; as &rsquo;ud turpentine and bees&rsquo;-vax
his memory for the next ten year or so, if I wos you,&rdquo; interposed
Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop a minute,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller; &ldquo;I wos a going to say, he
always brings now, a flat bottle as holds about a pint and a half
and fills it vith the pine-apple rum afore he goes avay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And empties it afore he comes back, I s&rsquo;pose?&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clean!&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller; &ldquo;never leaves nothin&rsquo; in it but
the cork and the smell; trust him for that, Sammy. Now, these
here fellows, my boy, are a goin&rsquo; to-night to get up the monthly
meetin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the Brick Lane Branch o&rsquo; the United Grand Junction
Ebenezer Temperance Association. Your mother-in-law <em>wos</em> a
goin&rsquo;, Sammy, but she&rsquo;s got the rheumatics, and can&rsquo;t; and I,
Sammy&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got the two tickets as wos sent her.&rdquo; Mr. Weller
communicated his secret with great glee, and winked so indefatigably
after doing so, that Sam began to think he must have
got the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tic doloureux</i> in his right eye-lid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said that young gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued his progenitor, looking round him very
cautiously, &ldquo;you and I&rsquo;ll go, punctival to the time. The deputy
shepherd won&rsquo;t, Sammy; the deputy shepherd won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Here
Mr. Weller was seized with a paroxysm of chuckles, which gradually
terminated in as near an approach to a choke as an elderly gentleman
can, with safety, sustain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I never see sitch an old ghost in all my born days,&rdquo;
exclaimed Sam, rubbing the old gentleman&rsquo;s back, hard enough to
set him on fire with friction. &ldquo;What are you a laughin&rsquo; at,
corpilence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush! Sammy,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, looking round him with
increased caution, and speaking in a whisper: &ldquo;Two friends o&rsquo;
mine, as works the Oxford Road, and is up to all kinds o&rsquo; games,
has got the deputy shepherd safe in tow, Sammy; and ven he
does come to the Ebenezer Junction (vich he&rsquo;s sure to do: for
they&rsquo;ll see him to the door, and shove him in if necessary), he&rsquo;ll be
as far gone in rum and water, as ever he wos at the Markis o&rsquo;
Granby, Dorkin&rsquo;, and that&rsquo;s not sayin&rsquo; a little neither.&rdquo; And with
this, Mr. Weller once more laughed immoderately, and once more
relapsed into a state of partial suffocation, in consequence.</p>

<p>Nothing could have been more in accordance with Sam Weller&rsquo;s
feelings, than the projected exposure of the real propensities and
qualities of the red-nosed man; and it being very near the appointed
hour of meeting, the father and son took their way at once
to Brick Lane: Sam not forgetting to drop his letter into a general
post-office as they walked along.</p>

<p>The monthly meetings of the Brick Lane Branch of the United
Grand Junction Ebenezer Temperance Association were held in a
large room, pleasantly and airily situated at the top of a safe and
commodious ladder. The president was the straight-walking Mr.
Anthony Humm, a converted fireman, now a schoolmaster,
and occasionally an itinerant preacher; and the secretary was Mr.
Jonas Mudge, chandler&rsquo;s-shop keeper, an enthusiastic and disinterested
vessel, who sold tea to the members. Previous to the
commencement of business, the ladies sat upon forms, and drank
tea, till such time as they considered it expedient to leave off; and
a large wooden money-box was conspicuously placed upon the
green baize cloth of the business table, behind which the secretary
stood, and acknowledged, with a gracious smile, every addition to
the rich vein of copper which lay concealed within.</p>

<p>On this particular occasion the women drank tea to a most
alarming extent; greatly to the horror of Mr. Weller senior,
who, utterly regardless of all Sam&rsquo;s admonitory nudgings, stared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
about him in every direction with the most undisguised astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sammy,&rdquo; whispered Mr. Weller, &ldquo;if some o&rsquo; these here people
don&rsquo;t want tappin&rsquo; to-morrow mornin&rsquo;, I ain&rsquo;t your father, and
that&rsquo;s wot it is. Why, this here old lady next me is a drowndin&rsquo;
herself in tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; murmured Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; whispered Mr. Weller, a moment afterwards, in a tone
of deep agitation, &ldquo;mark my words, my boy. If that &rsquo;ere secretary
fellow keeps on for only five minutes more, he&rsquo;ll blow hisself up
with toast and water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let him, if he likes,&rdquo; replied Sam; &ldquo;it ain&rsquo;t no bis&rsquo;ness
o&rsquo; yourn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If this here lasts much longer, Sammy,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, in
the same low voice, &ldquo;I shall feel it my duty, as a human bein&rsquo;, to
rise and address the cheer. There&rsquo;s a young &rsquo;ooman on the next
form but two, as has drunk nine breakfast cups and a half; and
she&rsquo;s a swellin&rsquo; wisibly before my wery eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is little doubt that Mr. Weller would have carried his
benevolent intention into immediate execution, if a great noise,
occasioned by putting up the cups and saucers, had not very fortunately
announced that the tea-drinking was over. The crockery
having been removed, the table with the green baize cover was
carried out into the centre of the room, and the business of the
evening was commenced by a little emphatic man, with a bald
head, and drab shorts, who suddenly rushed up the ladder, at the
imminent peril of snapping the two little legs encased in the drab
shorts, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, I move our excellent brother, Mr.
Anthony Humm, into the chair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ladies waved a choice collection of pocket-handkerchiefs at
this proposition; and the impetuous little man literally moved Mr.
Humm into the chair, by taking him by the shoulders and thrusting
him into a mahogany frame which had once represented that
article of furniture. The waving of handkerchiefs was renewed;
and Mr. Humm, who was a sleek, white-faced man, in a perpetual
perspiration, bowed meekly, to the great admiration of the females,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and formally took his seat. Silence was then proclaimed by the
little man in the drab shorts, and Mr. Humm rose and said&mdash;That,
with the permission of his Brick Lane Branch brothers
and sisters, then and there present, the secretary would read
the report of the Brick Lane Branch committee; a proposition
which was again received with a demonstration of pocket-handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>The secretary having sneezed in a very impressive manner, and
the cough which always seizes an assembly, when anything particular
is going to be done, having been duly performed, the following
document was read:</p>


<p class="report">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Report of the Committee of the Brick Lane Branch of the
United Grand Junction Ebenezer Temperance Association</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Your committee have pursued their grateful labours during
the past month, and have the unspeakable pleasure of reporting the
following additional cases of converts to Temperance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;H. Walker, tailor, wife, and two children. When in better
circumstances, owns to having been in the constant habit of drinking
ale and beer; says he is not certain whether he did not twice a
week for twenty years taste &lsquo;dog&rsquo;s nose,&rsquo; which your committee
find upon inquiry to be compounded of warm porter, moist sugar,
gin, and nutmeg (a groan, and &lsquo;So it is!&rsquo; from an elderly female).
Is now out of work and penniless; thinks it must be the porter
(cheers) or the loss of the use of his right hand; is not certain
which, but thinks it very likely that, if he had drunk nothing but
water all his life, his fellow-workman would never have stuck a
rusty needle in him, and thereby occasioned his accident (tremendous
cheering). Has nothing but cold water to drink, and never
feels thirsty (great applause).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Betsy Martin, widow, one child and one eye. Goes out charing
and washing, by the day; never had more than one eye, but
knows her mother drank bottled stout, and shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if that
caused it (immense cheering). Thinks it not impossible that if
she had always abstained from spirits, she might have had two eyes
by this time (tremendous applause). Used, at every place she went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
to, to have eighteenpence a day, a pint of porter, and a glass of
spirits; but since she became a member of the Brick Lane Branch,
has always demanded three and sixpence instead (the announcement
of this most interesting fact was received with deafening
enthusiasm).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Henry Beller was for many years toast-master at various corporation
dinners, during which time he drank a great deal of
foreign wine; may sometimes have carried a bottle or two home
with him; is not quite certain of that, but is sure if he did, that
he drank the contents. Feels very low and melancholy, is very
feverish, and has a constant thirst upon him; thinks it must be
the wine he used to drink (cheers). Is out of employ now: and
never touches a drop of foreign wine by any chance (tremendous
plaudits).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thomas Burton is a purveyor of cats&rsquo; meat to the Lord Mayor
and Sheriffs, and several members of the Common Council (the
announcement of this gentleman&rsquo;s name was received with breathless
interest). Has a wooden leg; finds a wooden leg expensive,
going over the stones; used to wear second-hand wooden legs, and
drink a glass of hot gin and water regularly every night&mdash;sometimes
two (deep sighs). Found the second-hand wooden legs split
and rot very quickly; is firmly persuaded that their constitution
was undermined by the gin and water (prolonged cheering). Buys
new wooden legs now, and drinks nothing but water and weak
tea. The new legs last twice as long as the others used to do,
and he attributes this solely to his temperate habits&rdquo; (triumphant
cheers).</p>

<p>Anthony Humm now moved that the assembly do regale itself
with a song. With a view to their rational and moral enjoyment,
Brother Mordlin had adapted the beautiful words of &ldquo;Who hasn&rsquo;t
heard of a Jolly Young Waterman?&rdquo; to the tune of the Old
Hundredth which he would request them to join him in singing
(great applause). He might take that opportunity of expressing
his firm persuasion that the late Mr. Dibdin, seeing the errors of
his former life, had written that song to show the advantages of
abstinence. It was a temperance song (whirlwinds of cheers).
The neatness of the young man&rsquo;s attire, the dexterity of his feathering,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the enviable state of mind which enabled him in the beautiful
words of the poet, to</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Row along, thinking of nothing at all,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">all combined to prove that he must have been a water-drinker
(cheers). Oh, what a state of virtuous jollity! (rapturous cheering).
And what was the young man&rsquo;s reward? Let all young men
present mark this:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The maidens all flock&rsquo;d to his boat so readily.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">(Loud cheers, in which the ladies joined.) What a bright example!
The sisterhood, the maidens, flocking round the young waterman,
and urging him along the stream of duty and of temperance.
But, was it the maidens of humble life only, who soothed, consoled,
and supported him? No!</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;He was always first oars with the fine city ladies.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">(Immense cheering.) The soft sex to a man&mdash;he begged pardon,
to a female&mdash;rallied round the young waterman, and turned with
disgust from the drinker of spirits (cheers). The Brick Lane
Branch brothers were watermen (cheers and laughter). That room
was their boat; that audience were the maidens; and he (Mr.
Anthony Humm), however unworthily, was &ldquo;first oars&rdquo; (unbounded
applause).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot does he mean by the soft sex, Sammy?&rdquo; inquired Mr.
Weller, in a whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The womin,&rdquo; said Sam, in the same tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t far out there, Sammy,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller; &ldquo;they
<em>must</em> be a soft sex,&mdash;a wery soft sex, indeed&mdash;if they let themselves
be gammoned by such fellers as him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Any further observations from the indignant old gentleman were
cut short by the announcement of the song, which Mr. Anthony
Humm gave out, two lines at a time, for the information of such of
his hearers as were unacquainted with the legend. While it was
being sung, the little man with the drab shorts disappeared; he
returned immediately on its conclusion, and whispered Mr. Anthony
Humm, with a face of the deepest importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; said Mr. Humm, holding up his hand in a deprecatory
manner, to bespeak the silence of such of the stout old ladies
as were yet a line or two behind; &ldquo;my friends, a delegate from the
Dorking Branch of our Society, Brother Stiggins, attends below.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Out came the pocket-handkerchiefs again, in greater force than
ever; for Mr. Stiggins was excessively popular among the female
constituency of Brick Lane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He may approach, I think,&rdquo; said Mr. Humm, looking round
him, with a fat smile. &ldquo;Brother Tadger, let him come forth and
greet us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little man in drab shorts who answered to the name of
Brother Tadger, bustled down the ladder with great speed, and
was immediately afterwards heard tumbling up with the Reverend
Mr. Stiggins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a comin&rsquo;, Sammy,&rdquo; whispered Mr. Weller, purple in the
countenance with suppressed laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo; to me,&rdquo; replied Sam, &ldquo;for I can&rsquo;t bear it.
He&rsquo;s close to the door. I hear him a-knockin&rsquo; his head again the
lath and plaster now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Sam Weller spoke, the little door flew open, and Brother
Tadger appeared, closely followed by the Reverend Mr. Stiggins,
who no sooner entered, than there was a great clapping of hands,
and stamping of feet, and flourishing of handkerchiefs; to all of
which manifestations of delight, Brother Stiggins returned no
other acknowledgment than staring with a wild eye, and a fixed
smile, at the extreme top of the wick of the candle on the table:
swaying his body to and fro, meanwhile, in a very unsteady and
uncertain manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you unwell, Brother Stiggins?&rdquo; whispered Mr. Anthony
Humm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am all right, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Stiggins, in a tone in which
ferocity was blended with an extreme thickness of utterance; &ldquo;I
am all right, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Anthony Humm, retreating a
few paces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe no man here has ventured to say that I am <em>not</em> all
right, sir?&rdquo; said Mr. Stiggins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, certainly not,&rdquo; said Mr. Humm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should advise him not to, sir; I should advise him not,&rdquo;
said Mr. Stiggins.</p>

<p>By this time the audience were perfectly silent, and waited with
some anxiety for the resumption of business.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you address the meeting, brother?&rdquo; said Mr. Humm, with
a smile of invitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Stiggins; &ldquo;no, sir. I will not, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The meeting looked at each other with raised eyelids; and a
murmur of astonishment ran through the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my opinion, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Stiggins, unbuttoning his coat,
and speaking very loudly; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s my opinion, sir, that this meeting
is drunk, sir. Brother Tadger, sir!&rdquo; said Mr. Stiggins, suddenly
increasing in ferocity, and turning sharp round on the little man in
the drab shorts, &ldquo;<em>you</em> are drunk, sir!&rdquo; With this, Mr. Stiggins,
entertaining a praiseworthy desire to promote the sobriety of the
meeting, and to exclude therefrom all improper characters, hit
Brother Tadger on the summit of the nose with such unerring
aim, that the drab shorts disappeared like a flash of lightning.
Brother Tadger had been knocked, head first, down the ladder.</p>

<p>Upon this, the women set up a loud and dismal screaming; and
rushing in small parties before their favourite brothers, flung their
arms around them to preserve them from danger. An instance of
affection which had nearly proved fatal to Humm, who, being
extremely popular, was all but suffocated, by the crowd of female
devotees that hung about his neck, and heaped caresses upon him.
The greater part of the lights were quickly put out, and nothing
but noise and confusion resounded on all sides.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Sammy,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, taking off his great-coat
with much deliberation, &ldquo;just you step out, and fetch in a
watchman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And wot are you a goin&rsquo; to do, the while?&rdquo; inquired Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never you mind me, Sammy,&rdquo; replied the old gentleman; &ldquo;I
shall ockipy myself in havin&rsquo; a small settlement with that &rsquo;ere
Stiggins.&rdquo; Before Sam could interfere to prevent it, his heroic
parent had penetrated into a remote corner of the room, and
attacked the Reverend Mr. Stiggins with manual dexterity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Come off!&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; cried Mr. Weller; and without further invitation
he gave the Reverend Mr. Stiggins a preliminary tap on the head,
and began dancing round him in a buoyant and cork-like manner,
which in a gentleman at his time of life was a perfect marvel to
behold.</p>

<p>Finding all remonstrance unavailing, Sam pulled his hat firmly
on, threw his father&rsquo;s coat over his arm, and taking the old man
round the waist, forcibly dragged him down the ladder, and into
the street; never releasing his hold, or permitting him to stop,
until they reached the corner. As they gained it, they could hear
the shouts of the populace, who were witnessing the removal of
the Reverend Mr. Stiggins to strong lodgings for the night: and
could hear the noise occasioned by the dispersion in various directions
of the members of the Brick Lane Branch of the United
Grand Junction Ebenezer Temperance Association.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;I wonder</span> what the foreman of the jury, whoever
he&rsquo;ll be, has got for breakfast,&rdquo; said Mr.
Snodgrass, by way of keeping up a conversation
on the eventful morning of the fourteenth of
February.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Perker, &ldquo;I hope he&rsquo;s got a good one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Highly important; very important, my dear sir,&rdquo; replied
Perker. &ldquo;A good, contented, well-breakfasted juryman, is a capital
thing to get hold of. Discontented or hungry jurymen, my dear
sir, always find for the plaintiff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless my heart,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, looking very blank; &ldquo;what
do they do that for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied the little man, coolly; &ldquo;saves
time, I suppose. If it&rsquo;s near the dinner-time, the foreman takes out
his watch when the jury has retired, and says, &lsquo;Dear me, gentlemen,
ten minutes to five, I declare! I dine at five, gentlemen.&rsquo; So
do I,&rsquo; says everybody else, except two men who ought to have dined
at three, and seem more than half disposed to stand out in consequence.
The foreman smiles, and puts up his watch:&mdash;&lsquo;Well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
gentlemen, what do we say, plaintiff or defendant, gentlemen? I
rather think, so far as I am concerned, gentlemen,&mdash;I say, I rather
think,&mdash;but don&rsquo;t let that influence you&mdash;I <em>rather</em> think the
plaintiff&rsquo;s the man.&rsquo; Upon this, two or three other men are sure
to say that they think so too&mdash;as of course they do; and then
they get on very unanimously and comfortably. Ten minutes past
nine!&rdquo; said the little man, looking at his watch. &ldquo;Time we were
off, my dear sir; breach of promise trial&mdash;court is generally full in
such cases. You had better ring for a coach, my dear sir, or we
shall be rather late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick immediately rang the bell; and a coach having
been procured, the four Pickwickians and Mr. Perker ensconced
themselves therein, and drove to Guildhall; Sam Weller, Mr.
Lowten, and the blue bag, following in a cab.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lowten,&rdquo; said Perker, when they reached the outer hall of the
court, &ldquo;put Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s friends in the students&rsquo; box; Mr. Pickwick
himself had better sit by me. This way, my dear sir, this
way.&rdquo; Taking Mr. Pickwick by the coat-sleeve, the little man led
him to the low seat just beneath the desks of the King&rsquo;s Counsel,
which is constructed for the convenience of attorneys, who from
that spot can whisper into the ear of the leading counsel in the
case, any instructions that may be necessary during the progress of
the trial. The occupants of this seat are invisible to the great
body of spectators, inasmuch as they sit on a much lower level
than either the barristers or the audience, whose seats are raised
above the floor. Of course they have their backs to both, and
their faces towards the judge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the witness-box, I suppose?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, pointing
to a kind of pulpit, with a brass rail, on his left hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the witness-box, my dear sir,&rdquo; replied Perker, disinterring
a quantity of papers from the blue bag, which Lowten had
just deposited at his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, pointing to a couple of enclosed
seats on his right, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s where the jurymen sit, is it not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The identical place, my dear sir,&rdquo; replied Perker, tapping the
lid of his snuff-box.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick stood up in a state of great agitation, and took a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
glance at the court. There were already a pretty large sprinkling
of spectators in the gallery, and a numerous muster of gentlemen
in wigs, in the barristers&rsquo; seats: who presented, as a body, all that
pleasing and extensive variety of nose and whisker for which the
bar of England is so justly celebrated. Such of the gentlemen as
had a brief to carry, carried it in as conspicuous a manner as
possible, and occasionally scratched their noses therewith, to impress
the fact more strongly on the observation of the spectators.
Other gentlemen, who had no briefs to show, carried under their
arms goodly octavos with a red label behind, and that under-done-pie-crust-coloured
cover, which is technically known as &ldquo;law calf.&rdquo;
Others, who had neither briefs nor books, thrust their hands into
their pockets, and looked as wise as they conveniently could;
others, again, moved here and there with great restlessness and
earnestness of manner, content to awaken thereby the admiration
and astonishment of the uninitiated strangers. The whole, to the
great wonderment of Mr. Pickwick, were divided into little groups,
who were chatting and discussing the news of the day in the most
unfeeling manner possible,&mdash;just as if no trial at all were coming on.</p>

<p>A bow from Mr. Phunky, as he entered, and took his seat behind
the row appropriated to the King&rsquo;s Counsel, attracted Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
attention; and he had scarcely returned it, when Mr.
Serjeant Snubbin appeared, followed by Mr. Mallard, who half
hid the Serjeant behind a large crimson bag, which he placed on the
table, and after shaking hands with Perker, withdrew. Then there
entered two or three more Serjeants; and among them, one with a
fat body and a red face, who nodded in a friendly manner to Mr.
Serjeant Snubbin, and said it was a fine morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that red-faced man, who said it was a fine morning,
and nodded to our counsel?&rdquo; whispered Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz,&rdquo; replied Perker. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s opposed to us;
he leads on the other side. That gentleman behind him is Mr.
Skimpin, his junior.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick was on the point of inquiring, with great abhorrence
of the man&rsquo;s cold-blooded villainy, how Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz,
who was counsel for the opposite party, dared to presume to tell
Mr. Serjeant Snubbin, who was counsel for him, that it was a fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
morning, when he was interrupted by a general rising of the
barristers, and a loud cry of &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; from the officers of the
court. Looking round, he found that this was caused by the
entrance of the judge.</p>

<p>Mr. Justice Stareleigh (who sat in the absence of the Chief
Justice, occasioned by indisposition), was a most particularly short
man, and so fat, that he seemed all face and waistcoat. He rolled
in, upon two little turned legs, and having bobbed gravely to the
bar, who bobbed gravely to him, put his little legs underneath his
table, and his little three-cornered hat upon it; and when Mr.
Justice Stareleigh had done this, all you could see of him was two
queer little eyes, one broad pink face, and somewhere about half of
a big and very comical-looking wig.</p>

<p>The judge had no sooner taken his seat, than the officer on the
floor of the court called out &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; in a commanding tone,
upon which another officer in the gallery cried &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; in an
angry manner, whereupon three or four more ushers shouted
&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; in a voice of indignant remonstrance. This being done,
a gentleman in black, who sat below the judge, proceeded to call
over the names of the jury; and after a great deal of bawling, it
was discovered that only ten special jurymen were present. Upon
this, Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz prayed a <em>tales</em>; the gentleman in black
then proceeded to press into the special jury, two of the common
jurymen; and a greengrocer and a chemist were caught directly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Answer to your names, gentlemen, that you may be sworn,&rdquo;
said the gentleman in black. &ldquo;Richard Upwitch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said the greengrocer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thomas Groffin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said the chemist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take the book, gentlemen. You shall well and truly <span class="nobreak">try&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg this court&rsquo;s pardon,&rdquo; said the chemist, who was a tall,
thin, yellow-visaged man, &ldquo;but I hope this court will excuse my
attendance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On what grounds, sir?&rdquo; said Mr. Justice Stareleigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no assistant, my Lord,&rdquo; said the chemist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help that, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Justice Stareleigh. &ldquo;You
should hire one.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t afford it, my Lord,&rdquo; rejoined the chemist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you ought to be able to afford it, sir,&rdquo; said the judge,
reddening; for Mr. Justice Stareleigh&rsquo;s temper bordered on the
irritable, and brooked no contradiction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know I <em>ought</em> to do, if I got on as well as I deserved, but I
don&rsquo;t, my Lord,&rdquo; answered the chemist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Swear the gentleman,&rdquo; said the judge, peremptorily.</p>

<p>The officer had got no further than the &ldquo;You shall well and
truly try,&rdquo; when he was again interrupted by the chemist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am to be sworn, my Lord, am I?&rdquo; said the chemist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, sir,&rdquo; said the testy little judge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, my Lord,&rdquo; replied the chemist, in a resigned manner.
&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;ll be murder before this trial&rsquo;s over; that&rsquo;s all. Swear
me, if you please, sir;&rdquo; and sworn the chemist was, before the
judge could find words to utter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I merely wanted to observe, my Lord,&rdquo; said the chemist, taking
his seat with great deliberation, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;ve left nobody but an
errand-boy in my shop. He is a very nice boy, my Lord, but he
is not acquainted with drugs; and I know that the prevailing impression
on his mind, is that Epsom salts means oxalic acid; and
syrup of senna, laudanum. That&rsquo;s all, my Lord.&rdquo; With this, the
tall chemist composed himself into a comfortable attitude, and,
assuming a pleasant expression of countenance, appeared to have
prepared himself for the worst.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick was regarding the chemist with feelings of the
deepest horror, when a slight sensation was perceptible in the body
of the court; and immediately afterwards Mrs. Bardell, supported
by Mrs. Cluppins, was led in, and placed, in a drooping state, at
the other end of the seat on which Mr. Pickwick sat. An extra-sized
umbrella was then handed in by Mr. Dodson, and a pair of
pattens by Mr. Fogg, each of whom had prepared a most sympathising
and melancholy face for the occasion. Mrs. Sanders then
appeared, leading in Master Bardell. At sight of her child, Mrs.
Bardell started; suddenly recollecting herself, she kissed him in a
frantic manner; then relapsing into a state of hysterical imbecility,
the good lady requested to be informed where she was. In reply
to this, Mrs. Cluppins and Mrs. Sanders turned their heads away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
and wept, while Messrs. Dodson and Fogg entreated the plaintiff to
compose herself. Serjeant Buzfuz rubbed his eyes very hard with
a large white handkerchief, and gave an appealing look towards the
jury, while the judge was visibly affected, and several of the beholders
tried to cough down their emotions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good notion that, indeed,&rdquo; whispered Perker to Mr.
Pickwick. &ldquo;Capital fellows those Dodson and Fogg; excellent
ideas of effect, my dear sir, excellent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Perker spoke, Mrs. Bardell began to recover by slow degrees,
while Mrs. Cluppins, after a careful survey of Master Bardell&rsquo;s
buttons and the button-holes to which they severally belonged,
placed him on the floor of the court in front of his mother,&mdash;a
commanding position in which he could not fail to awaken the
full commiseration and sympathy of both judge and jury. This
was not done without considerable opposition, and many tears, on
the part of the young gentleman himself, who had certain inward
misgivings that the placing him within the full glare of the judge&rsquo;s
eye was only a formal prelude to his being immediately ordered
away for instant execution, or for transportation beyond the seas,
during the whole term of his natural life, at the very least.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bardell and Pickwick,&rdquo; cried the gentleman in black, calling on
the case, which stood first on the list.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am for the plaintiff, my Lord,&rdquo; said Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is with you, brother Buzfuz?&rdquo; said the judge. Mr.
Skimpin bowed, to intimate that he was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I appear for the defendant, my Lord,&rdquo; said Mr. Serjeant
Snubbin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anybody with you, brother Snubbin?&rdquo; inquired the court.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Phunky, my Lord,&rdquo; replied Serjeant Snubbin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Serjeant Buzfuz and Mr. Skimpin for the plaintiff,&rdquo; said the
judge, writing down the names in his note-book, and reading as he
wrote; &ldquo;for the defendant, Serjeant Snubbin and Mr. Monkey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beg your Lordship&rsquo;s pardon, Phunky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, very good,&rdquo; said the judge; &ldquo;I never had the pleasure of
hearing the gentleman&rsquo;s name before.&rdquo; Here Mr. Phunky bowed
and smiled and the judge bowed and smiled too, and then Mr.
Phunky, blushing into the very whites of his eyes, tried to look as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
if he didn&rsquo;t know that everybody was gazing at him: a thing
which no man ever succeeded in doing yet, or, in all reasonable
probability, ever will.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said the judge.</p>

<p>The ushers again called silence, and Mr. Skimpin proceeded to
&ldquo;open the case;&rdquo; and the case appeared to have very little inside
it when he had opened it, for he kept such particulars as he knew,
completely to himself, and sat down, after a lapse of three minutes,
leaving the jury in precisely the same advanced stage of wisdom as
they were in before.</p>

<p>Serjeant Buzfuz then rose with all the majesty and dignity which
the grave nature of the proceedings demanded, and having whispered
to Dodson, and conferred briefly with Fogg, pulled his gown
over his shoulders, settled his wig, and addressed the jury.</p>

<p>Serjeant Buzfuz began by saying, that never, in the whole course
of his professional experience&mdash;never, from the very first moment
of his applying himself to the study and practice of the law&mdash;had
he approached a case with feelings of such deep emotion, or with
such a heavy sense of the responsibility imposed upon him&mdash;a
responsibility, he would say, which he could never have supported,
were he not buoyed up and sustained by a conviction so strong,
that it amounted to positive certainty that the cause of truth and
justice, or, in other words, the cause of his much-injured and most
oppressed client, must prevail with the high-minded and intelligent
dozen of men whom he now saw in that box before him.</p>

<p>Counsel usually begin in this way, because it puts the jury on
the very best terms with themselves, and makes them think what
sharp fellows they must be. A visible effect was produced immediately;
several jurymen beginning to take voluminous notes
with the utmost eagerness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have heard from my learned friend, gentlemen,&rdquo; continued
Serjeant Buzfuz, well knowing that, from the learned friend
alluded to, the gentlemen of the jury had heard just nothing at all&mdash;&ldquo;you
have heard from my learned friend, gentlemen, that this is an
action for a breach of promise of marriage, in which the damages are
laid at £1500. But you have not heard from my learned friend,
inasmuch as it did not come within my learned friend&rsquo;s province to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
tell you, what are the facts and circumstances of the case. Those
facts and circumstances, gentlemen, you shall hear detailed by me
and proved by the unimpeachable female whom I will place in
that box before you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz, with a tremendous emphasis on the
word &ldquo;box,&rdquo; smote his table with a mighty sound, and glanced at
Dodson and Fogg, who nodded admiration of the serjeant, and
indignant defiance of the defendant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The plaintiff, gentlemen,&rdquo; continued Serjeant Buzfuz, in a soft
and melancholy voice, &ldquo;the plaintiff is a widow; yes, gentlemen,
a widow. The late Mr. Bardell, after enjoying, for many years,
the esteem and confidence of his sovereign, as one of the guardians
of his royal revenues, glided almost imperceptibly from the world,
to seek elsewhere for that repose and peace which a custom-house
can never afford.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this pathetic description of the decease of Mr. Bardell, who
had been knocked on the head with a quart-pot in a public-house
cellar, the learned serjeant&rsquo;s voice faltered, and he proceeded with
emotion:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some time before his death, he had stamped his likeness upon
a little boy. With this little boy, the only pledge of her departed
exciseman, Mrs. Bardell shrunk from the world, and courted the
retirement and tranquillity of Goswell Street; and here she placed
in her front parlour window a written placard, bearing this inscription&mdash;&lsquo;Apartments
furnished for a single gentleman. Inquire
within.&rsquo;&rdquo; Here Serjeant Buzfuz paused, while several gentlemen
of the jury took a note of the document.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no date to that, is there, sir?&rdquo; inquired a juror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no date, gentlemen,&rdquo; replied Serjeant Buzfuz: &ldquo;but
I am instructed to say that it was put in the plaintiff&rsquo;s parlour-window
just this time three years. I entreat the attention of the
jury to the wording of this document. &lsquo;Apartments furnished for
a single gentleman&rsquo;! Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s opinions of the opposite sex,
gentlemen, were derived from a long contemplation of the inestimable
qualities of her lost husband. She had no fear, she had
no distrust, she had no suspicion, all was confidence and reliance.
&lsquo;Mr. Bardell,&rsquo; said the widow; &lsquo;Mr. Bardell was a man of honour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Mr. Bardell was a man of his word, Mr. Bardell was no deceiver,
Mr. Bardell was once a single gentleman himself; <em>to</em> single gentlemen
I look for protection, for assistance, for comfort, and for
consolation; <em>in</em> single gentlemen I shall perpetually see something
to remind me of what Mr. Bardell was, when he first won my
young and untried affections; to a single gentleman, then, shall
my lodgings be let.&rsquo; Actuated by this beautiful and touching
impulse (among the best impulses of our imperfect nature, gentlemen),
the lonely and desolate widow dried her tears, furnished the
first floor, caught the innocent boy to her maternal bosom, and
put the bill up in her parlour-window. Did it remain there long?
No. The serpent was on the watch, the train was laid, the mine
was preparing, the sapper and miner was at work. Before the bill
had been in the parlour-window three days&mdash;three days&mdash;gentlemen&mdash;a
Being erect upon two legs, and bearing all the outward
semblance of a man, and not of a monster, knocked at the door of
Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s house. He inquired within; he took the lodgings;
and on the very next day he entered into possession of them.
This man was Pickwick&mdash;Pickwick, the defendant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Serjeant Buzfuz, who had proceeded with such volubility that
his face was perfectly crimson, here paused for breath. The silence
awoke Mr. Justice Stareleigh, who immediately wrote down something
with a pen, without any ink in it, and looked unusually
profound, to impress the jury with the belief that he always thought
most deeply with his eyes shut. Serjeant Buzfuz proceeded:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of this man Pickwick I will say little; the subject presents
but few attractions; and I, gentlemen, am not the man, nor are
you, gentlemen, the men, to delight in the contemplation of
revolting heartlessness, and of systematic villainy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Mr. Pickwick, who had been writhing in silence for some
time, gave a violent start, as if some vague idea of assaulting
Serjeant Buzfuz, in the august presence of justice and law, suggested
itself to his mind. An admonitory gesture from Perker
restrained him, and he listened to the learned gentleman&rsquo;s continuation
with a look of indignation, which contrasted forcibly
with the admiring faces of Mrs. Cluppins and Mrs. Sanders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say systematic villainy, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Serjeant Buzfuz,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
looking through Mr. Pickwick and talking <em>at</em> him; &ldquo;and when I
say systematic villainy, let me tell the defendant Pickwick, if he be
in court, as I am informed he is, that it would have been more
decent in him, more becoming, in better judgment, and in better
taste, if he had stopped away. Let me tell him, gentlemen, that
any gestures of dissent or disapprobation in which he may indulge
in this court will not go down with you; that you will know how
to value and how to appreciate them; and let me tell him further,
as my lord will tell you, gentlemen, that a counsel, in the discharge
of his duty to his client, is neither to be intimidated nor bullied, nor
put down; and that any attempt to do either the one or the other,
or the first or the last, will recoil on the head of the attempter, be
he plaintiff or be he defendant, be his name Pickwick, or Noakes,
or Stoakes, or Stiles, or Brown, or Thompson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This little divergence from the subject in hand had, of course,
the intended effect of turning all eyes to Mr. Pickwick. Serjeant
Buzfuz, having partially recovered from the state of moral elevation
into which he had lashed himself, resumed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall show you, gentlemen, that for two years Pickwick
continued to reside constantly, and without interruption or intermission,
at Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s house. I shall show you that Mrs.
Bardell, during the whole of that time, waited on him, attended to
his comforts, cooked his meals, looked out his linen for the washerwoman
when it went abroad, darned, aired, and prepared it for
wear, when it came home, and, in short, enjoyed his fullest trust
and confidence. I shall show you that, on many occasions, he gave
halfpence, and on some occasions even sixpences, to her little boy;
and I shall prove to you, by a witness whose testimony it will be
impossible for my learned friend to weaken or controvert, that on
one occasion he patted the boy on the head, and, after inquiring
whether he had won <em>alley tors</em> or <em>commoneys</em> lately (both of which
I understand to be a particular species of marbles much prized
by the youth of this town), made use of this remarkable expression:
&lsquo;How should you like to have another father?&rsquo; I shall prove to
you, gentlemen, that about a year ago, Pickwick suddenly began
to absent himself from home, during long intervals, as if with the
intention of gradually breaking off from my client; but I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
show you also, that his resolution was not at that time sufficiently
strong, or that his better feelings conquered, if better feelings he
has, or that the charms and accomplishments of my client prevailed
against his unmanly intentions; by proving to you, that on
one occasion, when he returned from the country, he distinctly and
in terms, offered her marriage: previously, however, taking special
care that there should be no witness to their solemn contract;
and I am in a situation to prove to you, on the testimony of three
of his own friends&mdash;most unwilling witnesses, gentlemen&mdash;most
unwilling witnesses&mdash;that on that morning he was discovered by
them holding the plaintiff in his arms, and soothing her agitation
by his caresses and endearments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A visible impression was produced upon the auditors by this
part of the learned serjeant&rsquo;s address. Drawing forth two very
small scraps of paper, he proceeded:</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, gentlemen, but one word more. Two letters have
passed between these parties, letters which are admitted to be in
the handwriting of the defendant, and which speak volumes
indeed. These letters, too, bespeak the character of the man.
They are not open, fervent, eloquent epistles, breathing nothing
but the language of affectionate attachment. They are covert,
sly, underhanded communications, but, fortunately, far more
conclusive than if couched in the most glowing language and
the most poetic imagery&mdash;letters that must be viewed with a
cautious and suspicious eye&mdash;letters that were evidently intended
at the time, by Pickwick, to mislead and delude any third parties
into whose hands they might fall. Let me read the first:&mdash;&lsquo;Garraway&rsquo;s,
twelve o&rsquo;clock. Dear Mrs. B.&mdash;Chops and Tomato
sauce. Yours, <span class="smcap">Pickwick</span>.&rsquo; Gentlemen, what does this mean?
&lsquo;Chops and Tomato sauce. Yours, Pickwick!&rsquo; Chops! Gracious
heavens! and Tomato sauce! Gentlemen, is the happiness of a
sensitive and confiding female to be trifled away by such shallow
artifices as these? The next has no date whatever, which is in
itself suspicious. &lsquo;Dear Mrs. B., I shall not be at home till to-morrow.
Slow coach.&rsquo; And then follows this very remarkable
expression. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble yourself about the warming-pan.&rsquo;
The warming-pan! Why, gentlemen, who <em>does</em> trouble himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
about a warming-pan? When was the peace of mind of man or
woman broken or disturbed by a warming-pan, which is in itself a
harmless, a useful, and I will add, gentlemen, a comforting article
of domestic furniture? Why is Mrs. Bardell so earnestly entreated
not to agitate herself about this warming-pan, unless (as is no
doubt the case) it is a mere cover for hidden fire&mdash;a mere substitute
for some endearing word of promise, agreeably to a preconcerted
system of correspondence, artfully contrived by Pickwick with a
view to his contemplated desertion, and which I am not in a condition
to explain? And what does this allusion to the slow coach
mean? For aught I know, it may be a reference to Pickwick himself,
who has most unquestionably been a criminally slow coach
during the whole of this transaction, but whose speed will now be
very unexpectedly accelerated, and whose wheels, gentlemen, as
he will find to his cost, will very soon be greased by you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz paused in this place, to see whether the
jury smiled at his joke; but as nobody took it but the greengrocer,
whose sensitiveness on the subject was very probably occasioned
by his having subjected a chaise-cart to the process in question on
that identical morning, the learned serjeant considered it advisable
to undergo a slight relapse into the dismals before he concluded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But enough of this, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz; &ldquo;it
is difficult to smile with an aching heart; it is ill jesting when our
deepest sympathies are awakened. My client&rsquo;s hopes and prospects
are ruined, and it is no figure of speech to say that her occupation
is gone indeed. The bill is down&mdash;but there is no tenant. Eligible
single gentlemen pass and repass&mdash;but there is no invitation for
them to inquire within or without. All is gloom and silence in the
house; even the voice of the child is hushed; his infant sports are
disregarded when his mother weeps; his &lsquo;alley tors&rsquo; and his &lsquo;commoneys&rsquo;
are alike neglected; he forgets the long familiar cry of
&lsquo;knuckle-down,&rsquo; and at tip-cheese, or odd and even, his hand is out.
But Pickwick, gentlemen, Pickwick, the ruthless destroyer of this
domestic oasis in the desert of Goswell Street&mdash;Pickwick, who has
choked up the well, and thrown ashes on the sward&mdash;Pickwick, who
comes before you to-day with his heartless Tomato sauce and
warming-pans&mdash;Pickwick still rears his head with unblushing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
effrontery, and gazes without a sigh on the ruin he has made.
Damages, gentlemen&mdash;heavy damages&mdash;is the only punishment
with which you can visit him; the only recompense you can award
to my client. And for those damages she now appeals to an enlightened,
a high-minded, a right-feeling, a conscientious, a dispassionate,
a sympathising, a contemplative jury of her civilised
countrymen.&rdquo; With this beautiful peroration, Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz
sat down, and Mr. Justice Stareleigh woke up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call Elizabeth Cluppins,&rdquo; said Serjeant Buzfuz, rising a
minute afterwards, with renewed vigour.</p>

<p>The nearest usher called for Elizabeth Tuppins; another one,
at a little distance off, demanded Elizabeth Jupkins; and a third
rushed in a breathless state into King Street, and screamed for
Elizabeth Muffins till he was hoarse.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mrs. Cluppins, with the combined assistance of Mrs.
Bardell, Mrs. Sanders, Mr. Dodson, and Mr. Fogg, was hoisted into
the witness-box; and when she was safely perched on the top step,
Mrs. Bardell stood on the bottom one, with the pocket-handkerchief
and pattens in one hand, and a glass bottle that might hold about
a quarter of a pint of smelling salts in the other, ready for any
emergency. Mrs. Sanders, whose eyes were intently fixed on the
judge&rsquo;s face, planted herself close by, with the large umbrella:
keeping her right thumb pressed on the spring with an earnest
countenance, as if she were fully prepared to put it up at a moment&rsquo;s
notice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Cluppins,&rdquo; said Serjeant Buzfuz, &ldquo;pray compose yourself,
ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; Of course, directly Mrs. Cluppins was desired to
compose herself she sobbed with increased vehemence, and gave
divers alarming manifestations of an approaching fainting fit, or,
as she afterwards said, of her feelings being too many for her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you recollect, Mrs. Cluppins,&rdquo; said Serjeant Buzfuz, after
a few unimportant questions, &ldquo;do you recollect being in Mrs.
Bardell&rsquo;s back one pair of stairs, on one particular morning in July
last, when she was dusting Pickwick&rsquo;s apartment?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my Lord and Jury, I do,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Cluppins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s sitting-room was the first-floor front, I
believe?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it were, sir,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Cluppins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What were you doing in the back room, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; inquired
the little judge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord and Jury,&rdquo; said Mrs. Cluppins, with interesting
agitation, &ldquo;I will not deceive you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better not, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the little judge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was there,&rdquo; resumed Mrs. Cluppins, &ldquo;unbeknown to Mrs.
Bardell; I had been out with a little basket, gentlemen, to buy three
pound of red kidney purtaties, which was three pound tuppense
ha&rsquo;penny, when I see Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s street door on the jar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the what?&rdquo; exclaimed the little judge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Partly open, my Lord,&rdquo; said Serjeant Snubbin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She <em>said</em> on the jar,&rdquo; said the little judge, with a cunning
look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the same, my Lord,&rdquo; said Serjeant Snubbin. The
little judge looked doubtful and said he&rsquo;d make a note of it. Mrs.
Cluppins then resumed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I walked in, gentlemen, just to say good mornin&rsquo;, and went, in
a permiscuous manner, up-stairs, and into the back room. Gentlemen,
there was the sound of voices in the front room, <span class="nobreak">and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And you listened, I believe, Mrs. Cluppins?&rdquo; said Serjeant
Buzfuz.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beggin&rsquo; your pardon, sir,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Cluppins, in a majestic
manner, &ldquo;I would scorn the haction. The voices was very loud,
sir, and forced themselves upon my ear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Mrs. Cluppins, you were not listening, but you heard the
voices. Was one of these voices Pickwick&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it were, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Mrs. Cluppins, after distinctly stating that Mr. Pickwick
addressed himself to Mrs. Bardell, repeated by slow degrees, and
by dint of many questions, the conversation with which our readers
are already acquainted.</p>

<p>The jury looked suspicious, and Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz smiled and
sat down. They looked positively awful when Serjeant Snubbin
intimated that he should not cross-examine the witness, for Mr.
Pickwick wished it to be distinctly stated that it was due to her to
say, that her account was in substance correct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Cluppins having once broken the ice, thought it a favourable
opportunity for entering into a short dissertation on her own
domestic affairs; so, she straightway proceeded to inform the court
that she was the mother of eight children at that present speaking,
and that she entertained confident expectations of presenting Mr.
Cluppins with a ninth, somewhere about that day six months. At
this interesting point, the little judge interposed most irascibly;
and the effect of the interposition was, that both the worthy lady
and Mrs. Sanders were politely taken out of court, under the
escort of Mr. Jackson, without further parley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nathaniel Winkle!&rdquo; said Mr. Skimpin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; replied a feeble voice. Mr. Winkle entered the
witness-box, and having been duly sworn, bowed to the judge with
considerable deference.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at me, sir,&rdquo; said the judge, sharply, in acknowledgment
of the salute; &ldquo;look at the jury.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Winkle obeyed the mandate, and looked at the place where
he thought it most probable the jury might be; for seeing anything
in his then state of intellectual complication was wholly out
of the question.</p>

<p>Mr. Winkle was then examined by Mr. Skimpin, who, being a
promising young man of two or three and forty, was of course
anxious to confuse a witness who was notoriously predisposed in
favour of the other side, as much as he could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Skimpin, &ldquo;have the goodness to let his
Lordship and the jury know what your name is, will you?&rdquo; and
Mr. Skimpin inclined his head on one side to listen with great
sharpness to the answer, and glanced at the jury meanwhile, as if
to imply that he rather expected Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s natural taste for
perjury would induce him to give some name which did not belong
to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Winkle,&rdquo; replied the witness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your Christian name, sir?&rdquo; angrily inquired the little
judge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nathaniel, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Daniel,&mdash;any other name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nathaniel, sir&mdash;my Lord, I mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nathaniel Daniel, or Daniel Nathaniel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my Lord, only Nathaniel; not Daniel at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you tell me it was Daniel for, then, sir?&rdquo; inquired
the judge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t, my Lord,&rdquo; replied Mr. Winkle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did, sir,&rdquo; replied the judge, with a severe frown. &ldquo;How
could I have got Daniel on my notes, unless you told me so, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This argument was, of course, unanswerable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Winkle has rather a short memory, my Lord,&rdquo; interposed
Mr. Skimpin, with another glance at the jury. &ldquo;We shall find
means to refresh it before we have quite done with him, I dare say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better be careful, sir,&rdquo; said the little judge, with a
sinister look at the witness.</p>

<p>Poor Mr. Winkle bowed, and endeavoured to feign an easiness
of manner which, in his then state of confusion, gave him rather
the air of a disconcerted pickpocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Winkle,&rdquo; said Mr. Skimpin, &ldquo;attend to me, if you
please, sir; and let me recommend you, for your own sake, to bear
in mind his Lordship&rsquo;s injunction to be careful. I believe you
are a particular friend of Pickwick, the defendant, are you
not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have known Mr. Pickwick now, as well as I recollect at this
moment, <span class="nobreak">nearly&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray, Mr. Winkle, do not evade the question. Are you, or are
you not, a particular friend of the defendant&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was just about to say <span class="nobreak">that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you, or will you not, answer my question, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t answer the question you&rsquo;ll be committed, sir,&rdquo;
interposed the little judge, looking over his note-book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Skimpin, &ldquo;yes or no, if you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; replied Mr. Winkle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are. And why couldn&rsquo;t you say that at once, sir?
Perhaps you know the plaintiff, too? Eh, Mr. Winkle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know her; I&rsquo;ve seen her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t know her, but you&rsquo;ve seen her? Now, have the
goodness to tell the gentlemen of the jury what you mean by <em>that</em>,
Mr. Winkle.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean that I am not intimate with her, but I have seen her
when I went to call on Mr. Pickwick in Goswell Street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How often have you seen her, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How often?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Winkle, how often? I&rsquo;ll repeat the question for you
a dozen times if you require it, sir.&rdquo; And the learned gentleman,
with a firm and steady frown, placed his hands on his hips, and
smiled suspiciously at the jury.</p>

<p>On this question there arose the edifying brow-beating, customary
on such points. First of all, Mr. Winkle said it was quite
impossible for him to say how many times he had seen Mrs. Bardell.
Then he was asked if he had seen her twenty times, to which he
replied, &ldquo;Certainly,&mdash;more than that.&rdquo; Then he was asked
whether he hadn&rsquo;t seen her a hundred times&mdash;whether he couldn&rsquo;t
swear that he had seen her more than fifty times&mdash;whether he didn&rsquo;t
know that he had seen her at least seventy-five times&mdash;and so forth;
the satisfactory conclusion which was arrived at, at last, being, that
he had better take care of himself, and mind what he was about.
The witness having been by these means reduced to the requisite
ebb of nervous perplexity, the examination was continued as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray Mr. Winkle, do you remember calling on the defendant
Pickwick at these apartments in the plaintiff&rsquo;s house in Goswell
Street, on one particular morning, in the month of July last?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you accompanied on that occasion by a friend of the
name of Tupman, and another of the name of Snodgrass?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are they here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, they are,&rdquo; replied Mr. Winkle, looking very earnestly
towards the spot where his friends were stationed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray attend to me, Mr. Winkle, and never mind your friends,&rdquo;
said Mr. Skimpin, with another expressive look at the jury. &ldquo;They
must tell their stories without any previous consultation with you,
if none has yet taken place (another look at the jury). Now, sir,
tell the gentlemen of the jury what you saw on entering the defendant&rsquo;s
room, on this particular morning. Come; out with it,
sir: we must have it, sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The defendant, Mr. Pickwick, was holding the plaintiff in his
arms, with his hands clasping her waist,&rdquo; replied Mr. Winkle, with
natural hesitation, &ldquo;and the plaintiff appeared to have fainted
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear the defendant say anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard him call Mrs. Bardell a good creature, and I heard him
ask her to compose herself, for what a situation it was, if anybody
should come, or words to that effect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Winkle, I have only one more question to ask you,
and I beg you to bear in mind his lordship&rsquo;s caution. Will you
undertake to swear that Pickwick, the defendant, did not say on the
occasion in question, &lsquo;My dear Mrs. Bardell, you&rsquo;re a good creature;
compose yourself to this situation, for to this situation you must
come,&rsquo; or words to <em>that</em> effect?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t understand him so, certainly,&rdquo; said Mr. Winkle,
astounded at this ingenious dove-tailing of the few words he had
heard. &ldquo;I was on the staircase, and couldn&rsquo;t hear distinctly; the
impression on my mind <span class="nobreak">is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The gentlemen of the jury want none of the impressions on
your mind, Mr. Winkle, which I fear would be of little service to
honest, straightforward men,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Skimpin. &ldquo;You
were on the staircase, and didn&rsquo;t distinctly hear; but you will not
swear that Mr. Pickwick did not make use of the expressions I have
quoted? Do I understand that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I will not,&rdquo; replied Mr. Winkle; and down sat Mr.
Skimpin with a triumphant countenance.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s case had not gone off in so particularly happy
a manner, up to this point, that it could very well afford to have
any additional suspicion cast upon it. But as it could afford to be
placed in a rather better light, if possible, Mr. Phunky rose for the
purpose of getting something important out of Mr. Winkle in
cross-examination. Whether he did get anything important out
of him will immediately appear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe, Mr. Winkle,&rdquo; said Mr. Phunky, &ldquo;that Mr. Pickwick
is not a young man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; replied Mr. Winkle; &ldquo;old enough to be my father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have told my learned friend that you have known Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Pickwick a long time. Had you ever any reason to suppose or
believe that he was about to be married?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no; certainly not;&rdquo; replied Mr. Winkle with so much
eagerness, that Mr. Phunky ought to have got him out of the
box with all possible despatch. Lawyers hold that there are two
kinds of particularly bad witnesses: a reluctant witness, and a too-willing
witness; it was Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s fate to figure in both characters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will even go further than this, Mr. Winkle,&rdquo; continued Mr.
Phunky in a most smooth and complacent manner. &ldquo;Did you ever
see anything in Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s manner and conduct towards the
opposite sex, to induce you to believe that he ever contemplated
matrimony of late years, in any case?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no; certainly not,&rdquo; replied Mr. Winkle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has his behaviour, when females have been in the case, always
been that of a man who, having attained a pretty advanced period
of life, content with his own occupations and amusements, treats
them only as a father might his daughters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not the least doubt of it,&rdquo; replied Mr. Winkle, in the fulness
of his heart. &ldquo;That is&mdash;yes&mdash;oh yes&mdash;certainly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have never known anything in his behaviour towards
Mrs. Bardell, or any other female, in the least degree suspicious?&rdquo;
said Mr. Phunky, preparing to sit down; for Serjeant Snubbin was
winking at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;n&mdash;no,&rdquo; replied Mr. Winkle, &ldquo;except on one trifling
occasion which, I have no doubt, might be easily explained.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, if the unfortunate Mr. Phunky had sat down when
Serjeant Snubbin winked at him, or if Serjeant Buzfuz had stopped
this irregular cross-examination at the outset (which he knew
better than to do; observing Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s anxiety, and well
knowing it would, in all probability, lead to something serviceable to
him), this unfortunate admission would not have been elicited.
The moment the words fell from Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s lips, Mr. Phunky
sat down, and Serjeant Snubbin rather hastily told him he might
leave the box, which Mr. Winkle prepared to do with great readiness,
when Serjeant Buzfuz stopped him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay, Mr. Winkle, stay!&rdquo; said Serjeant Buzfuz. &ldquo;Will your
Lordship have the goodness to ask him, what this one instance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
suspicious behaviour towards females, on the part of this gentleman,
who is old enough to be his father, was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You hear what the learned counsel says, sir,&rdquo; observed the
judge, turning to the miserable and agonised Mr. Winkle. &ldquo;Describe
the occasion to which you refer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; said Mr. Winkle, trembling with anxiety, &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;d
rather not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; said the little judge; &ldquo;but you must.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amid the profound silence of the whole court, Mr. Winkle
faltered out that the trifling circumstance of suspicion was Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s being found in a lady&rsquo;s sleeping apartment at midnight;
which had terminated, he believed, in the breaking off of the
projected marriage of the lady in question, and had led, he knew,
to the whole party being forcibly carried before George Nupkins,
Esq., magistrate and justice of the peace for the borough of Ipswich!</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may leave the box, sir,&rdquo; said Serjeant Snubbin. Mr.
Winkle <em>did</em> leave the box, and rushed with delirious haste to the
George and Vulture, where he was discovered some hours afterwards
by the waiter, groaning in a hollow and dismal manner,
with his head buried beneath the sofa cushions.</p>

<p>Tracy Tupman, and Augustus Snodgrass, were severally called
into the box; both corroborated the testimony of their unhappy
friend; and each was driven to the verge of desperation by excessive
badgering.</p>

<p>Susannah Sanders was then called, and examined by Serjeant
Buzfuz, and cross-examined by Serjeant Snubbin. Had always
said and believed that Pickwick would marry Mrs. Bardell; knew
that Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s being engaged to Pickwick was the current topic
of conversation in the neighbourhood, after the fainting in July;
had been told it herself by Mrs. Mudberry which kept a mangle, and
Mrs. Bunkin which clear-starched, but did not see either Mrs.
Mudberry or Mrs. Bunkin in court. Had heard Pickwick ask the
little boy how he should like to have another father. Did not
know that Mrs. Bardell was at that time keeping company with the
baker, but did know that the baker was then a single man and is
now married. Couldn&rsquo;t swear that Mrs. Bardell was not very fond
of the baker, but should think that the baker was not very fond of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Mrs. Bardell, or he wouldn&rsquo;t have married somebody else. Thought
Mrs. Bardell fainted away on the morning in July, because Pickwick
asked her to name the day: knew that she (witness) fainted away
stone dead when Mr. Sanders asked <em>her</em> to name the day, and believed
that everybody as called herself a lady would do the same,
under similar circumstances. Heard Pickwick ask the boy the
question about the marbles, but upon her oath did not know the
difference between an alley tor and a commoney.</p>

<p>By the <span class="smcap">Court</span>&mdash;During the period of her keeping company
with Mr. Sanders had received love-letters, like other ladies. In
the course of their correspondence Mr. Sanders had often called
her a &ldquo;duck,&rdquo; but never &ldquo;chops,&rdquo; nor yet &ldquo;tomato sauce.&rdquo; He
was particularly fond of ducks. Perhaps if he had been as fond of
chops and tomato sauce, he might have called her that, as a term
of affection.</p>

<p>Serjeant Buzfuz now rose with more importance than he had
yet exhibited, if that were possible, and vociferated: &ldquo;Call Samuel
Weller.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was quite unnecessary to call Samuel Weller; for Samuel
Weller stepped briskly into the box the instant his name was pronounced;
and placing his hat on the floor, and his arms on the
rail, took a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of the bar, and a comprehensive survey
of the bench, with a remarkably cheerful and lively aspect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name, sir?&rdquo; inquired the judge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sam Weller, my Lord,&rdquo; replied that gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you spell it with a &lsquo;V&rsquo; or a &lsquo;W&rsquo;?&rdquo; inquired the judge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That depends upon the taste and fancy of the speller, my
Lord,&rdquo; replied Sam; &ldquo;I never had occasion to spell it more than
once or twice in my life, but I spells it with a &lsquo;V&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here a voice in the gallery exclaimed aloud, &ldquo;Quite right,
too, Samivel, quite right. Put it down a &lsquo;we,&rsquo; my Lord, put it
down a &lsquo;we&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is that who dares to address the court?&rdquo; said the little
judge, looking up. &ldquo;Usher!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring that person here instantly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>But as the usher didn&rsquo;t find the person, he didn&rsquo;t bring him;
and, after a great commotion, all the people who had got up to
look for the culprit sat down again. The little judge turned to the
witness as soon as his indignation would allow him to speak, and said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know who that was, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rayther suspect it was my father, my Lord,&rdquo; replied Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you see him here, now?&rdquo; said the judge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t, my Lord,&rdquo; replied Sam, staring right up into the
lantern in the roof of the court.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you could have pointed him out, I would have committed
him instantly,&rdquo; said the judge.</p>

<p>Sam bowed his acknowledgments and turned, with unimpaired
cheerfulness of countenance, towards Serjeant Buzfuz.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Weller,&rdquo; said Serjeant Buzfuz.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, sir,&rdquo; replied Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe you are in the service of Mr. Pickwick, the defendant
in this case. Speak up, if you please, Mr. Weller.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean to speak up, sir,&rdquo; replied Sam; &ldquo;I am in the service of
that &rsquo;ere gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n, and a wery good service it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little to do, and plenty to get, I suppose?&rdquo; said Serjeant
Buzfuz, with jocularity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, quite enough to get, sir, as the soldier said ven they
ordered him three hundred and fifty lashes,&rdquo; replied Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not tell us what the soldier, or any other man, said,
sir,&rdquo; interposed the judge, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not evidence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wery good, my Lord,&rdquo; replied Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you recollect anything particular happening on the morning
when you were first engaged by the defendant; eh, Mr. Weller?&rdquo;
said Serjeant Buzfuz.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes I do, sir,&rdquo; replied Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have the goodness to tell the jury what it was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had a reg&rsquo;lar new fit out o&rsquo; clothes that mornin&rsquo;, gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n of
the jury,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;and that was a wery partickler and uncommon
circumstance vith me in those days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hereupon there was a general laugh; and the little judge,
looking with an angry countenance over his desk, said, &ldquo;You had
better be careful, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;So Mr. Pickwick said at the time, my Lord,&rdquo; replied Sam;
&ldquo;and I wos wery careful o&rsquo; that &rsquo;ere suit o&rsquo; clothes; wery careful
indeed, my Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The judge looked sternly at Sam for full two minutes, but Sam&rsquo;s
features were so perfectly calm and serene that the judge said
nothing, and motioned Serjeant Buzfuz to proceed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to tell me, Mr. Weller,&rdquo; said Serjeant Buzfuz,
folding his arms emphatically, and turning half-round to the
jury, as if in mute assurance that he would bother the witness
yet: &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me, Mr. Weller, that you saw nothing
of this fainting on the part of the plaintiff in the arms of the defendant,
which you have heard described by the witnesses?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; replied Sam, &ldquo;I was in the passage till they
called me up, and then the old lady was not there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, attend, Mr. Weller,&rdquo; said Serjeant Buzfuz, dipping a
large pen into the inkstand before him, for the purpose of frightening
Sam with a show of taking down his answer. &ldquo;You were in the
passage, and yet saw nothing of what was going forward. Have you
a pair of eyes, Mr. Weller?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have a pair of eyes,&rdquo; replied Sam, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s just it.
If they wos a pair o&rsquo; patent double million magnifyin&rsquo; gas microscopes
of hextra power, p&rsquo;raps I might be able to see through a
flight o&rsquo; stairs, and a deal door; but bein&rsquo; only eyes, you see, my
wision&rsquo;s limited.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this answer, which was delivered without the slightest
appearance of irritation, and with the most complete simplicity and
equanimity of manner, the spectators tittered, the little judge
smiled, and Serjeant Buzfuz looked particularly foolish. After a
short consultation with Dodson and Fogg, the learned Serjeant
again turned towards Sam, and said, with a painful effort to conceal
his vexation, &ldquo;Now, Mr. Weller, I&rsquo;ll ask you a question on another
point, if you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Sam, with the utmost good-humour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember going up to Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s house, one night
in November last?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, wery well.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you <em>do</em> remember that, Mr. Weller,&rdquo; said Serjeant Buzfuz,
recovering his spirits; &ldquo;I thought we should get something
at last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rayther thought that, too, sir,&rdquo; replied Sam; and at this the
spectators tittered again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well; I suppose you went up to have a little talk about this
trial&mdash;eh, Mr. Weller?&rdquo; said Serjeant Buzfuz, looking knowingly
at the jury.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went up to pay the rent; but we <em>did</em> get a talkin&rsquo; about the
trial,&rdquo; replied Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you did get a talking about the trial,&rdquo; said Serjeant Buzfuz,
brightening up with the anticipation of some important discovery.
&ldquo;Now what passed about the trial; will you have the goodness to
tell us, Mr. Weller?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vith all the pleasure in life, sir,&rdquo; replied Sam. &ldquo;Arter a few
unimportant obserwations from the two virtuous females as has
been examined here to-day, the ladies gets into a wery great state
o&rsquo; admiration at the honourable conduct of Mr. Dodson and Fogg&mdash;them
two gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n as is settin&rsquo; near you now.&rdquo; This, of course,
drew general attention to Dodson and Fogg, who looked as virtuous
as possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The attorneys for the plaintiff,&rdquo; said Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz.
&ldquo;Well! They spoke in high praise of the honourable conduct of
Messrs, Dodson and Fogg, the attorneys for the plaintiff, did they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;they said what a wery gen&rsquo;rous thing it
was o&rsquo; them to have taken up the case on spec, and to charge nothing
at all for costs, unless they got &rsquo;em out of Mr. Pickwick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this very unexpected reply, the spectators tittered again,
and Dodson and Fogg, turning very red, leant over to Serjeant
Buzfuz, and in a hurried manner whispered something in his ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are quite right,&rdquo; said Serjeant Buzfuz aloud, with affected
composure. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly useless, my lord, attempting to get at
any evidence through the impenetrable stupidity of this witness.
I will not trouble the court by asking him any more questions.
Stand down, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would any other gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n like to ask me anythin&rsquo;?&rdquo; inquired
Sam, taking up his hat, and looking round most deliberately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not I, Mr. Weller, thank you,&rdquo; said Serjeant Snubbin,
laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may go down, sir,&rdquo; said Serjeant Buzfuz, waving his
hand impatiently. Sam went down accordingly, after doing
Messrs. Dodson and Fogg&rsquo;s case as much harm as he conveniently
could, and saying just as little respecting Mr. Pickwick
as might be, which was precisely the object he had had in view all
along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no objection to admit, my Lord,&rdquo; said Serjeant Snubbin,
&ldquo;if it will save the examination of another witness, that Mr. Pickwick
has retired from business, and is a gentleman of considerable
independent property.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Serjeant Buzfuz, putting in the two letters to
be read. &ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s my case, my Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Serjeant Snubbin then addressed the jury on behalf of the
defendant; and a very long and a very emphatic address he
delivered, in which he bestowed the highest possible eulogiums on
the conduct and character of Mr. Pickwick; but inasmuch as our
readers are far better able to form a correct estimate of that gentleman&rsquo;s
merits and deserts, than Serjeant Snubbin could possibly
be, we do not feel called upon to enter at any length into the
learned gentleman&rsquo;s observations. He attempted to show that
the letters which had been exhibited, merely related to Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
dinner, or to the preparations for receiving him in his apartments
on his return from some country excursion. It is sufficient
to add in general terms, that he did the best he could for Mr.
Pickwick; and the best, as everybody knows, on the infallible
authority of the old adage, could do no more.</p>

<p>Mr. Justice Stareleigh summed up, in the old-established and
most approved form. He read as much of his notes to the jury as
he could decipher on so short a notice, and made running comments
on the evidence as he went along. If Mrs. Bardell were right, it
was perfectly clear that Mr. Pickwick was wrong, and if they
thought the evidence of Mrs. Cluppins worthy of credence they
would believe it, and, if they didn&rsquo;t, why they wouldn&rsquo;t. If they
were satisfied that a breach of promise of marriage had been committed,
they would find for the plaintiff with such damages as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
they thought proper; and if, on the other hand, it appeared to
them that no promise of marriage had ever been given, they would
find for the defendant with no damages at all. The jury then
retired to their private room to talk the matter over, and the judge
retired to <em>his</em> private room, to refresh himself with a mutton chop
and a glass of sherry.</p>

<p>An anxious quarter of an hour elapsed; the jury came back;
the judge was fetched in. Mr. Pickwick put on his spectacles, and
gazed at the foreman with an agitated countenance and a quickly
beating heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said the individual in black, &ldquo;are you all agreed
upon your verdict?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are,&rdquo; replied the foreman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you find for the plaintiff, gentlemen, or for the defendant?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the plaintiff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With what damages, gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seven hundred and fifty pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick took off his spectacles, carefully wiped the glasses,
folded them into their case, and put them in his pocket; then having
drawn on his gloves with great nicety, and stared at the foreman
all the while, he mechanically followed Mr. Perker and the blue
bag out of court.</p>

<p>They stopped in a side room while Perker paid the court fees;
and here, Mr. Pickwick was joined by his friends. Here, too, he
encountered Messrs. Dodson and Fogg, rubbing their hands with
every token of outward satisfaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, gentlemen?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir?&rdquo; said Dodson: for self and partner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You imagine you&rsquo;ll get your costs, don&rsquo;t you, gentlemen?&rdquo;
said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>Fogg said they thought it rather probable. Dodson smiled, and
said they&rsquo;d try.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may try, and try, and try again, Messrs. Dodson and
Fogg,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick vehemently, &ldquo;but not one farthing of
costs or damages do you ever get from me, if I spend the rest of my
existence in a debtor&rsquo;s prison.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; laughed Dodson. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll think better of that,
before next term, Mr. Pickwick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He, he, he! We&rsquo;ll soon see about that, Mr. Pickwick,&rdquo;
grinned Fogg.</p>

<p>Speechless with indignation, Mr. Pickwick allowed himself to be
led by his solicitor and friends to the door, and there assisted into
a hackney-coach, which had been fetched for the purpose, by the
ever-watchful Sam Weller.</p>

<p>Sam had put up the steps, and was preparing to jump upon the
box, when he felt himself gently touched on the shoulder; and
looking round, his father stood before him. The old gentleman&rsquo;s
countenance wore a mournful expression, as he shook his head
gravely, and said, in warning accents:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know&rsquo;d what &rsquo;ud come o&rsquo; this here mode o&rsquo; doin&rsquo; bisness.
Oh Sammy, Sammy, vy worn&rsquo;t there a alleybi!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="cap pd05"><span class="upper">&ldquo;But</span> surely, my dear sir,&rdquo; said little Perker, as he
stood in Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s apartment on the morning
after the trial: &ldquo;surely you don&rsquo;t really mean&mdash;really
and seriously now, and irritation apart&mdash;that
you won&rsquo;t pay these costs and damages?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not one halfpenny,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, firmly; &ldquo;not one
halfpenny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hooroar for the principle, as the money-lender said ven he
vouldn&rsquo;t renew the bill,&rdquo; observed Mr. Weller, who was clearing
away the breakfast things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;have the goodness to step down-stairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cert&rsquo;nly, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller; and acting on Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
gentle hint, Sam retired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Perker,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with great seriousness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
manner, &ldquo;my friends here have endeavoured to dissuade me from
this determination, but without avail. I shall employ myself as
usual, until the opposite party have the power of issuing a legal
process of execution against me; and if they are vile enough
to avail themselves of it, and to arrest my person, I shall yield
myself up with perfect cheerfulness and content of heart. When
can they do this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They can issue execution, my dear sir, for the amount of the
damages and taxed costs, next term,&rdquo; replied Perker; &ldquo;just two
months hence, my dear sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;Until that time, my dear
fellow, let me hear no more of the matter. And now,&rdquo; continued
Mr. Pickwick, looking round on his friends with a good-humoured
smile, and a sparkle in the eye which no spectacles could dim or
conceal, &ldquo;the only question is, Where shall we go next?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass were too much affected by
their friend&rsquo;s heroism to offer any reply. Mr. Winkle had not
yet sufficiently recovered the recollection of his evidence at the
trial, to make any observations on any subject, so Mr. Pickwick
paused in vain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said that gentleman, &ldquo;if you leave me to suggest our
destination, I say Bath. I think none of us have ever been
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nobody had; and as the proposition was warmly seconded by
Perker, who considered it extremely probable that if Mr. Pickwick
saw a little change and gaiety he would be inclined to think better
of his determination, and worse of a debtor&rsquo;s prison, it was carried
unanimously: and Sam was at once despatched to the White Horse
Cellar, to take five places by the half-past seven o&rsquo;clock coach, next
morning.</p>

<p>There were just two places to be had inside, and just three to be
had out; so Sam Weller booked for them all, and having exchanged
a few compliments with the booking-office clerk on the subject of
a pewter half-crown which was tendered him as a portion of his
&ldquo;change,&rdquo; walked back to the George and Vulture, where he was
pretty busily employed until bed-time in reducing clothes and
linen into the smallest possible compass, and exerting his mechanical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
genius in constructing a variety of ingenious devices for keeping
the lids on boxes which had neither locks nor hinges.</p>

<p>The next was a very unpropitious morning for a journey&mdash;muggy,
damp, and drizzly. The horses in the stages that were
going out, and had come through the city, were smoking so that
the outside passengers were invisible. The newspaper-sellers
looked moist, and smelt mouldy; the wet ran off the hats of the
orange-vendors as they thrust their heads into the coach-windows,
and diluted the insides in a refreshing manner. The Jews with the
fifty-bladed penknives shut them up in despair; the men with the
pocket-books made pocket-books of them. Watch-guards and
toasting-forks were alike at a discount, and pencil-cases and sponges
were a drug in the market.</p>

<p>Leaving Sam Weller to rescue the luggage from the seven
or eight porters who flung themselves savagely upon it, the
moment the coach stopped: and finding that they were about
twenty minutes too early; Mr. Pickwick and his friends went
for shelter into the travellers&rsquo; room&mdash;the last resource of human
dejection.</p>

<p>The travellers&rsquo; room at the White Horse Cellar is of course uncomfortable;
it would be no travellers&rsquo; room if it were not. It is
the right-hand parlour, into which an aspiring kitchen fire-place
appears to have walked, accompanied by a rebellious poker, tongs,
and shovel. It is divided into boxes, for the solitary confinement
of travellers, and is furnished with a clock, a looking-glass, and a
live waiter; which latter article is kept in a small kennel for washing
glasses, in the corner of the apartment.</p>

<p>One of these boxes was occupied, on this particular occasion, by
a stern-eyed man of about five-and-forty, who had a bald and
glossy forehead, with a good deal of black hair at the sides and
back of his head, and large black whiskers. He was buttoned up
to the chin in a brown coat; and had a large sealskin travelling
cap, and a great-coat and cloak, lying on the seat beside him. He
looked up from his breakfast as Mr. Pickwick entered, with a
fierce and peremptory air, which was very dignified; and having
scrutinised that gentleman and his companions to his entire satisfaction,
hummed a tune, in a manner which seemed to say that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
rather suspected somebody wanted to take advantage of him, but
it wouldn&rsquo;t do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Waiter,&rdquo; said the gentleman with the whiskers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir?&rdquo; replied a man with a dirty complexion, and a towel of
the same, emerging from the kennel before mentioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some more toast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Buttered toast, mind,&rdquo; said the gentleman, fiercely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;rectly, sir,&rdquo; replied the waiter.</p>

<p>The gentleman with the whiskers hummed a tune in the same
manner as before, and pending the arrival of the toast advanced to
the front of the fire, and taking his coat-tails under his arms, looked
at his boots, and ruminated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder whereabouts in Bath this coach puts up?&rdquo; said Mr.
Pickwick, mildly addressing Mr. Winkle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hum&mdash;eh&mdash;what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said the strange man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I made an observation to my friend, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick,
always ready to enter into conversation. &ldquo;I wondered at
what house the Bath coach put up. Perhaps you can inform me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to Bath?&rdquo; said the strange man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And those other gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are going also,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not inside&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be damned if you&rsquo;re going inside,&rdquo; said the
strange man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not all of us,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not all of you,&rdquo; said the strange man emphatically. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
taken two places. If they try to squeeze six people into an infernal
box that only holds four, I&rsquo;ll take a post-chaise and bring an action.
I&rsquo;ve paid my fare. It won&rsquo;t do; I told the clerk when I took my
places that it wouldn&rsquo;t do. I know these things have been done.
I know they are done every day; but <em>I</em> never was done, and I
never will be. Those who know me best, best know it; crush me!&rdquo;
Here the fierce gentleman rang the bell with great violence, and
told the waiter he&rsquo;d better bring the toast in five seconds, or he&rsquo;d
know the reason why.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My good sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;you will allow me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
observe that this is a very unnecessary display of excitement. I have
only taken places inside for two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear it,&rdquo; said the fierce man. &ldquo;I withdraw my
expressions. I tender an apology. There&rsquo;s my card. Give me
your acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With great pleasure, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;We are to
be fellow-travellers, and I hope shall find each other&rsquo;s society
mutually agreeable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope we shall,&rdquo; said the fierce gentleman. &ldquo;I know we
shall. I like your looks; they please me. Gentlemen, your hands
and names. Know me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course, an interchange of friendly salutations followed this
gracious speech, and the fierce gentleman immediately proceeded
to inform the friends, in the same short, abrupt, jerking sentences,
that his name was Dowler; that he was going to Bath on pleasure;
that he was formerly in the army; that he had now set up in
business as a gentleman; that he lived upon the profits; and that
the individual for whom the second place was taken, was a personage
no less illustrious than Mrs. Dowler, his lady wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a fine woman,&rdquo; said Mr. Dowler. &ldquo;I am proud of her.
I have reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope I shall have the pleasure of judging,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick,
with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall,&rdquo; replied Dowler. &ldquo;She shall know you. She shall
esteem you. I courted her under singular circumstances. I won
her through a rash vow. Thus. I saw her; I loved her: I proposed;
she refused me.&mdash;&lsquo;You love another?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Spare my blushes.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I
know him.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;You do.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Very good; if he remains here, I&rsquo;ll
skin him.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord bless me!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, involuntarily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you skin the gentleman, sir?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Winkle, with
a very pale face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wrote him a note. I said it was a painful thing. And so
it was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Winkle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said I had pledged my word as a gentleman to skin him.
My character was at stake. I had no alternative. As an officer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
in His Majesty&rsquo;s service, I was bound to skin him. I regretted the
necessity, but it must be done. He was open to conviction. He
saw that the rules of the service were imperative. He fled. I
married her. Here&rsquo;s the coach. That&rsquo;s her head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Mr. Dowler concluded, he pointed to a stage which had just
driven up, from the open window of which a rather pretty face in
a bright blue bonnet was looking among the crowd on the pavement:
most probably for the rash man himself. Mr. Dowler
paid his bill and hurried out with his travelling-cap, coat, and
cloak; and Mr. Pickwick and his friends followed to secure their
places.</p>

<p>Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass had seated themselves at the
back part of the coach; Mr. Winkle had got inside; and Mr.
Pickwick was preparing to follow him, when Sam Weller came
up to his master, and whispering in his ear, begged to speak to him,
with an air of the deepest mystery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s rayther a rum go, sir,&rdquo; replied Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This here, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Sam. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m wery much afeerd, sir,
that the properiator o&rsquo; this here coach is a playin&rsquo; some imperence
vith us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is that, Sam?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t the names
down on the way-bill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The names is not only down on the vay-bill, sir,&rdquo; replied
Sam, &ldquo;but they&rsquo;ve painted vun on &rsquo;em up, on the door o&rsquo; the
coach.&rdquo; As Sam spoke, he pointed to that part of the coach door
on which the proprietor&rsquo;s name usually appears; and there, sure
enough, in gilt letters of a goodly size, was the magic name of
<span class="smcap">Pickwick</span>!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, quite staggered by the
coincidence; &ldquo;what a very extraordinary thing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but that ain&rsquo;t all,&rdquo; said Sam, again directing his master&rsquo;s
attention to the coach door; &ldquo;not content vith writin&rsquo; up Pickwick,
they puts &lsquo;Moses&rsquo; afore it, vich I call addin&rsquo; insult to injury,
as the parrot said ven they not only took him from his native land,
but made him talk the English langwidge arterwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s odd enough certainly, Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &ldquo;but if
we stand talking here, we shall lose our places.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot, ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; to be done in consequence, sir?&rdquo; exclaimed
Sam, perfectly aghast at the coolness with which Mr.
Pickwick prepared to ensconce himself inside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;What should be done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t nobody to be whopped for takin&rsquo; this here liberty, sir?&rdquo;
said Mr. Weller, who had expected that at least he would have
been commissioned to challenge the guard and coachman to a
pugilistic encounter on the spot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, eagerly; &ldquo;not on any
account. Jump up to your seat directly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wery much afeerd,&rdquo; muttered Sam to himself, as he
turned away, &ldquo;that somethin&rsquo; queer&rsquo;s come over the governor,
or he&rsquo;d never ha&rsquo; stood this so quiet. I hope that &rsquo;ere trial
hasn&rsquo;t broke his spirit, but it looks bad, wery bad.&rdquo; Mr.
Weller shook his head gravely; and it is worthy of remark,
as an illustration of the manner in which he took this circumstance
to heart, that he did not speak another word until the
coach reached the Kensington turnpike, which was so long a time
for him to remain taciturn, that the fact may be considered wholly
unprecedented.</p>

<p>Nothing worthy of special mention occurred during the journey.
Mr. Dowler related a variety of anecdotes, all illustrative of his
own personal prowess and desperation, and appealed to Mrs. Dowler
in corroboration thereof: when Mrs. Dowler invariably brought in,
in the form of an appendix, some remarkable fact or circumstance
which Mr. Dowler had forgotten, or had perhaps through modesty
omitted: for the addenda in every instance went to show that Mr.
Dowler was even more wonderful a fellow than he made himself
out to be. Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Winkle listened with great
admiration, and at intervals conversed with Mrs. Dowler, who was
a very agreeable and fascinating person. So what between Mr.
Dowler&rsquo;s stories, and Mrs. Dowler&rsquo;s charms, and Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
good humour, and Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s good listening, the insides contrived
to be very companionable all the way.</p>

<p>The outsides did as outsides always do. They were very cheerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and talkative at the beginning of every stage, and very dismal and
sleepy in the middle, and very bright and wakeful again towards the
end. There was one young gentleman in an india-rubber cloak,
who smoked cigars all day; and there was another young gentleman
in a parody upon a great-coat, who lighted a good many, and
feeling obviously unsettled after the second whiff, threw them away
when he thought nobody was looking at him. There was a third
young man on the box who wished to be learned in cattle, and
an old one behind who was familiar with farming. There was a
constant succession of Christian names in smock frocks and white
coats, who were invited to have a &ldquo;lift&rdquo; by the guard, and who
knew every horse and hostler on the road and off it: and there
was a dinner which would have been cheap at half-a-crown a
mouth, if any moderate number of mouths could have eaten it in
the time. And at seven o&rsquo;clock <span class="lowcap">P.M.</span>, Mr. Pickwick and his friends,
and Mr. Dowler and his wife, respectively retired to their private
sitting-rooms at the White Hart Hotel, opposite the Great Pump
Room, Bath, where the waiters, from their costume, might be
mistaken for Westminster boys, only they destroy the illusion by
behaving themselves much better.</p>

<p>Breakfast had scarcely been cleared away on the succeeding
morning, when a waiter brought in Mr. Dowler&rsquo;s card, with a
request to be allowed permission to introduce a friend. Mr.
Dowler at once followed up the delivery of the card, by bringing
himself and the friend also.</p>

<p>The friend was a charming young man of not much more than
fifty, dressed in a very bright blue coat with resplendent buttons,
black trousers, and the thinnest possible pair of highly-polished
boots. A gold eye-glass was suspended from his neck by a short
broad black ribbon; a gold snuff-box was lightly clasped in his left
hand; gold rings innumerable glittered on his fingers; and a large
diamond pin set in gold glistened in his shirt frill. He had a gold
watch, and a gold curb chain with large gold seals; and he carried
a pliant ebony cane with a heavy gold top. His linen was of the
very whitest, finest, and stiffest; his wig of the glossiest, blackest,
and curliest. His snuff was prince&rsquo;s mixture; his scent <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouquet du
roi</i>. His features were contracted into a perpetual smile; and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
teeth were in such perfect order that it was difficult at a small
distance to tell the real from the false.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pickwick,&rdquo; said Mr. Dowler; &ldquo;my friend, Angelo Cyrus
Bantam, Esquire, M.C. Bantam; Mr. Pickwick. Know each
other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome to Ba&mdash;ath, sir. This is indeed an acquisition.
Most welcome to Ba&mdash;ath, sir. It is long&mdash;very long, Mr. Pickwick,
since you drank the waters. It appears an age, Mr. Pickwick.
Re&mdash;markable!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such were the expressions with which Angelo Cyrus Bantam,
Esquire, M.C., took Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s hand; retaining it in his, meantime,
and shrugging up his shoulders with a constant succession of
bows, as if he really could not make up his mind to the trial of
letting it go again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a very long time since I drank the waters, certainly,&rdquo;
replied Mr. Pickwick; &ldquo;for to the best of my knowledge, I was
never here before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never in Ba&mdash;ath, Mr. Pickwick!&rdquo; exclaimed the Grand
Master, letting the hand fall in astonishment. &ldquo;Never in Ba&mdash;ath!
He! he! Mr. Pickwick, you are a wag. Not bad, not bad. Good,
good. He! he! he! Re&mdash;markable!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To my shame, I must say that I am perfectly serious,&rdquo; rejoined
Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;I really never was here before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; exclaimed the Grand Master, looking extremely
pleased; &ldquo;yes, yes&mdash;good, good&mdash;better and better. You are
the gentleman of whom we have heard. Yes; we know you, Mr.
Pickwick; we know you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The reports of the trial in those confounded papers,&rdquo; thought
Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;They have heard all about me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are the gentleman residing on Clapham Green,&rdquo; resumed
Bantam, &ldquo;who lost the use of his limbs from imprudently taking
cold after port wine; who could not be moved in consequence of
acute suffering, and who had the water from the King&rsquo;s Bath
bottled at one hundred and three degrees, and sent by waggon to
his bed-room in town, where he bathed, sneezed, and same day
recovered. Very re&mdash;markable!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick acknowledged the compliment which the supposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
implied, but had the self-denial to repudiate it, notwithstanding;
and taking advantage of a moment&rsquo;s silence on the part
of the M.C., begged to introduce his friends, Mr. Tupman, Mr.
Winkle, and Mr. Snodgrass. An introduction which overwhelmed
the M.C. with delight and honour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bantam,&rdquo; said Mr. Dowler, &ldquo;Mr. Pickwick and his friends
are strangers. They must put their names down. Where&rsquo;s the
book?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The register of the distinguished visitors in Ba&mdash;ath will be at
the Pump Room this morning at two o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; replied the M.C.
&ldquo;Will you guide our friends to that splendid building, and enable
me to procure their autographs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; rejoined Dowler. &ldquo;This is a long call. It&rsquo;s time to
go. I shall be here again in an hour. Come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a ball-night,&rdquo; said the M.C., again taking Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
hand as he rose to go. &ldquo;The ball-nights in Ba&mdash;ath are
moments snatched from Paradise; rendered bewitching by music,
beauty, elegance, fashion, etiquette, and&mdash;and&mdash;above all, by the
absence of tradespeople, who are quite inconsistent with Paradise;
and who have an amalgamation of themselves at the Guildhall
every fortnight, which is, to say the least, remarkable. Good-bye,
good-bye!&rdquo; and protesting all the way down-stairs that he
was most satisfied, and most delighted, and most overpowered,
and most flattered, Angelo Cyrus Bantam, Esquire, M.C., stepped
into a very elegant chariot that waited at the door, and rattled off.</p>

<p>At the appointed hour, Mr. Pickwick and his friends, escorted
by Dowler, repaired to the Assembly Rooms, and wrote their names
down in a book. An instance of condescension at which Angelo
Bantam was even more overpowered than before. Tickets of
admission to that evening&rsquo;s assembly were to have been prepared
for the whole party, but as they were not ready, Mr. Pickwick
undertook, despite all the protestations to the contrary of Angelo
Bantam, to send Sam for them at four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, to
the M.C.&rsquo;s house in Queen Square. Having taken a short walk
through the city, and arrived at the unanimous conclusion that
Park Street was very much like the perpendicular streets a man
sees in a dream, which he cannot get up for the life of him, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
returned to the White Hart, and despatched Sam on the errand to
which his master had pledged him.</p>

<p>Sam Weller put on his hat in a very easy and graceful manner,
and thrusting his hands in his waistcoat pockets, walked with great
deliberation to Queen Square, whistling, as he went along, several
of the most popular airs of the day, as arranged with entirely new
movements for that noble instrument the organ, either mouth or
barrel. Arriving at the number in Queen Square to which he had
been directed, he left off whistling, and gave a cheerful knock,
which was instantaneously answered by a powdered-headed footman
in gorgeous livery, and of symmetrical stature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this here Mr. Bantam&rsquo;s, old feller?&rdquo; inquired Sam Weller,
nothing abashed by the blaze of splendour which burst upon his
sight, in the person of the powdered-headed footman with the
gorgeous livery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, young man?&rdquo; was the haughty inquiry of the powdered-headed
footman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cos if it is, jist you step into him with that &rsquo;ere card, and
say Mr. Veller&rsquo;s a waitin&rsquo;, will you?&rdquo; said Sam. And saying it, he
very coolly walked into the hall, and sat down.</p>

<p>The powdered-headed footman slammed the door very hard,
and scowled very grandly; but both the slam and the scowl were
lost upon Sam, who was regarding a mahogany umbrella-stand with
every outward token of critical approval.</p>

<p>Apparently, his master&rsquo;s reception of the card had impressed
the powdered-headed footman in Sam&rsquo;s favour, for when he came
back from delivering it, he smiled in a friendly manner, and said that
the answer would be ready directly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wery good,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;Tell the old gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n not to
put himself in a perspiration. No hurry, six-foot. I&rsquo;ve had my
dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You dine early, sir,&rdquo; said the powdered-headed footman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I find I gets on better at supper when I does,&rdquo; replied Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you been long in Bath, sir?&rdquo; inquired the powdered-headed
footman. &ldquo;I have not had the pleasure of hearing of you
before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t created any wery surprisin&rsquo; sensation here, as yet,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
rejoined Sam, &ldquo;for me and the other fashionables only come
last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nice place, sir,&rdquo; said the powdered-headed footman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems so,&rdquo; observed Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pleasant society, sir,&rdquo; remarked the powdered-headed footman.
&ldquo;Very agreeable servants, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think they wos,&rdquo; replied Sam. &ldquo;Affable, unaffected,
say-nothing-to-nobody sort o&rsquo; fellers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, very much so indeed, sir,&rdquo; said the powdered-headed
footman, taking Sam&rsquo;s remark as a high compliment. &ldquo;Very much
so indeed. Do you do anything in this way, sir?&rdquo; inquired the
tall footman, producing a small snuff-box with a fox&rsquo;s head on the
top of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not without sneezing,&rdquo; replied Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it <em>is</em> difficult, sir, I confess,&rdquo; said the tall footman. &ldquo;It
may be done by degrees, sir. Coffee is the best practice. I carried
coffee, sir, for a long time. It looks very like rappee, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here, a sharp peal at the bell, reduced the powdered-headed
footman to the ignominious necessity of putting the fox&rsquo;s head in
his pocket, and hastening with a humble countenance to Mr.
Bantam&rsquo;s &ldquo;study.&rdquo; By-the-bye, who ever knew a man who never
read, or wrote either, who hadn&rsquo;t got some small back parlour
which he <em>would</em> call a study?</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is the answer, sir,&rdquo; said the powdered-headed footman.
&ldquo;I am afraid you&rsquo;ll find it inconveniently large.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it,&rdquo; said Sam, taking a letter with a small enclosure.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just possible as exhausted nature may manage to
surwive it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope we shall meet again, sir,&rdquo; said the powdered-headed
footman, rubbing his hands, and following Sam out to the door-step.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are wery obligin&rsquo;, sir,&rdquo; replied Sam. &ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t allow
yourself to be fatigued beyond your powers; there&rsquo;s a amiable
bein&rsquo;. Consider what you owe to society, and don&rsquo;t let yourself
be injured by too much work. For the sake o&rsquo; your feller creeturs,
keep yourself as quiet as you can; only think what a loss you would
be!&rdquo; With these pathetic words, Sam Weller departed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A very singular young man that,&rdquo; said the powdered-headed
footman, looking after Mr. Weller, with a countenance which
clearly showed he could make nothing of him.</p>

<p>Sam said nothing at all. He winked, shook his head, smiled,
winked again; and with an expression of countenance which seemed
to denote that he was greatly amused with something or other,
walked merrily away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you do anything in this way, sir?&rdquo; inquired the tall footman</p>
</div></div>

<p>At precisely twenty minutes before eight o&rsquo;clock that night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Angelo Cyrus Bantam, Esq., the Master of the Ceremonies,
emerged from his chariot at the door of the Assembly Rooms in
the same wig, the same teeth, the same eye-glass, the same watch
and seals, the same rings, the same shirt-pin, and the same cane.
The only observable alterations in his appearance were, that he
wore a brighter blue coat, with a white silk lining: black tights,
black silk stockings, and pumps, and a white waistcoat, and was, if
possible, just a thought more scented.</p>

<p>Thus attired, the Master of the Ceremonies, in strict discharge
of the important duties of his all-important office, planted himself
in the rooms to receive the company.</p>

<p>Bath being full, the company and the sixpences for tea poured
in, in shoals. In the ball-room, the long card-room, the octagonal
card-room, the staircases, and the passages, the hum of many
voices and the sound of many feet were perfectly bewildering.
Dresses rustled, feathers waved, lights shone, and jewels sparkled.
There was the music&mdash;not of the quadrille band, for it had not yet
commenced; but the music of soft tiny footsteps, with now and
then a clear merry laugh&mdash;low and gentle, but very pleasant to
hear in a female voice, whether in Bath or elsewhere. Brilliant
eyes, lighted up with pleasurable expectation, gleamed from every
side; and look where you would, some exquisite form glided
gracefully through the throng, and was no sooner lost, than it was
replaced by another as dainty and bewitching.</p>

<p>In the tea-room, and hovering round the card-tables, were a vast
number of queer old ladies and decrepit old gentlemen, discussing
all the small talk and scandal of the day, with a relish and gusto
which sufficiently bespoke the intensity of the pleasure they derived
from the occupation. Mingled with these groups, were three or
four matchmaking mammas, appearing to be wholly absorbed by
the conversation in which they were taking part, but failing not
from time to time to cast an anxious sidelong glance upon their
daughters, who, remembering the maternal injunction to make the
best use of their youth, had already commenced incipient flirtations
in the mislaying of scarves, putting on gloves, setting down cups,
and so forth; slight matters apparently, but which may be turned
to surprisingly good account by expert practitioners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>Lounging near the doors, and in remote corners, were various
knots of silly young men, displaying various varieties of puppyism
and stupidity; amusing all sensible people near them with their
folly and conceit; and happily thinking themselves the objects of
general admiration. A wise and merciful dispensation which no
good man will quarrel with.</p>

<p>And lastly, seated on some of the back benches, where they had
already taken up their positions for the evening, were divers unmarried
ladies past their grand climacteric, who, not dancing
because there were no partners for them, and not playing cards lest
they should be set down as irretrievably single, were in the favourable
situation of being able to abuse everybody without reflecting
on themselves. In short, they could abuse everybody, because
everybody was there. It was a scene of gaiety, glitter, and show;
of richly-dressed people, handsome mirrors, chalked floors, girandoles,
and wax candles; and in all parts of the scene, gliding from
spot to spot in silent softness, bowing obsequiously to this party,
nodding familiarly to that, and smiling complacently on all, was
the sprucely attired person of Angelo Cyrus Bantam, Esquire,
Master of the Ceremonies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop in the tea-room. Take your sixpenn&rsquo;orth. They lay on
hot water, and call it tea. Drink it,&rdquo; said Mr. Dowler, in a loud
voice, directing Mr. Pickwick, who advanced at the head of the
little party, with Mrs. Dowler on his arm. Into the tea-room Mr.
Pickwick turned; and catching sight of him, Mr. Bantam cork-screwed
his way through the crowd, and welcomed him with ecstasy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear sir, I am highly honoured. Ba&mdash;ath is favoured.
Mrs. Dowler, you embellish the rooms. I congratulate you on
your feathers. Re&mdash;markable!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anybody here?&rdquo; inquired Dowler, suspiciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anybody! The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élite</i> of Ba&mdash;ath. Mr. Pickwick, do you see
the lady in the gauze turban?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fat old lady?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick, innocently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, my dear sir&mdash;nobody&rsquo;s fat or old in Ba&mdash;ath. That&rsquo;s
the Dowager Lady Snuphanuph.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it indeed?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No less a person, I assure you,&rdquo; said the Master of the Ceremonies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
&ldquo;Hush. Draw a little nearer, Mr. Pickwick. You see
the splendidly dressed young man coming this way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The one with the long hair, and the particularly small forehead?&rdquo;
inquired Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The same. The richest young man in Ba&mdash;ath at this moment.
Young Lord Mutanhed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. You&rsquo;ll hear his voice in a moment, Mr. Pickwick. He&rsquo;ll
speak to me. The other gentleman with him, in the red under-waistcoat
and dark moustache, is the Honourable Mr. Crushton, his
bosom friend. How do you do, my lord?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Veway hot, Bantam,&rdquo; said his lordship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It <em>is</em> very warm, my lord,&rdquo; replied the M.C.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confounded,&rdquo; assented the Honourable Mr. Crushton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you seen his lordship&rsquo;s mail cart, Bantam?&rdquo; inquired
the Honourable Mr. Crushton, after a short pause, during which
young Lord Mutanhed had been endeavouring to stare Mr. Pickwick
out of countenance, and Mr. Crushton had been reflecting
what subject his lordship could talk about best.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me, no,&rdquo; replied the M.C. &ldquo;A mail cart! What an
excellent idea. Re&mdash;markable!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gwacious heavens!&rdquo; said his lordship, &ldquo;I thought evewebody
had seen the new mail cart; it&rsquo;s the neatest, pwettiest, gwacefullest
thing that ever wan upon wheels. Painted wed, with a cweam
piebald.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With a real box for the letters, and all complete,&rdquo; said the
Honourable Mr. Crushton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a little seat in fwont, with an iwon wail, for the dwiver,&rdquo;
added his lordship. &ldquo;I dwove it over to Bristol the other morning,
in a cwimson coat, with two servants widing a quarter of a mile
behind; and confound me if the people didn&rsquo;t wush out of their
cottages, and awest my pwogwess, to know if I wasn&rsquo;t the post.
Glorwious, glorwious!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this anecdote his lordship laughed very heartily, as did the
listeners, of course. Then, drawing his arm through that of the
obsequious Mr. Crushton, Lord Mutanhed walked away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Delightful young man, his lordship,&rdquo; said the Master of the
Ceremonies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;So I should think,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Pickwick, drily.</p>

<p>The dancing having commenced, the necessary introductions
having been made, and all preliminaries arranged, Angelo Bantam
rejoined Mr. Pickwick, and led him into the card-room.</p>

<p>Just at the very moment of their entrance, the Dowager Lady
Snuphanuph and two other ladies of an ancient and whist-like
appearance, were hovering over an unoccupied card-table; and
they no sooner set eyes upon Mr. Pickwick under the convoy of
Angelo Bantam, than they exchanged glances with each other,
seeing that he was precisely the very person they wanted, to make
up the rubber.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Bantam,&rdquo; said the Dowager Lady Snuphanuph,
coaxingly, &ldquo;find us some nice creature to make up this table;
there&rsquo;s a good soul.&rdquo; Mr. Pickwick happened to be looking another
way at the moment, so her ladyship nodded her head towards him,
and frowned expressively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friend, Mr. Pickwick, my lady, will be most happy, I am
sure, re&mdash;markably so,&rdquo; said the M.C., taking the hint. &ldquo;Mr.
Pickwick, Lady Snuphanuph&mdash;Mrs. Colonel Wugsby&mdash;Miss Bolo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick bowed to each of the ladies, and, finding escape
impossible, cut. Mr. Pickwick and Miss Bolo against Lady
Snuphanuph and Mrs. Colonel Wugsby.</p>

<p>As the trump card was turned up at the commencement of the
second deal, two young ladies hurried into the room, and took
their stations on either side of Mrs. Colonel Wugsby&rsquo;s chair, where
they waited patiently until the hand was over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Jane,&rdquo; said Mrs. Colonel Wugsby, turning to one of the
girls, &ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came to ask, ma, whether I might dance with the youngest
Mr. Crawley,&rdquo; whispered the prettier and younger of the two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good God, Jane, how can you think of such things?&rdquo; replied
the mamma, indignantly. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you repeatedly heard that
his father has eight hundred a-year, which dies with him? I am
ashamed of you. Not on any account.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ma,&rdquo; whispered the other, who was much older than her
sister and very insipid and artificial, &ldquo;Lord Mutanhed has been
introduced to me. I said I <em>thought</em> I wasn&rsquo;t engaged, ma.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a sweet pet, my love,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Colonel Wugsby,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
tapping her daughter&rsquo;s cheek with her fan, &ldquo;and are always to be
trusted. He&rsquo;s immensely rich, my dear. Bless you!&rdquo; With
these words Mrs. Colonel Wugsby kissed her eldest daughter most
affectionately, and frowning, in a warning manner, upon the other,
sorted her cards.</p>

<p>Poor Mr. Pickwick! he had never played with three thorough-paced
female card-players before. They were so desperately sharp,
that they quite frightened him. If he played a wrong card, Miss
Bolo looked a small armoury of daggers; if he stopped to consider
which was the right one, Lady Snuphanuph would throw herself
back in her chair, and smile with a mingled glance of impatience
and pity to Mrs. Colonel Wugsby; at which Mrs. Colonel Wugsby
would shrug up her shoulders and cough, as much as to say she
wondered whether he ever would begin. Then, at the end of every
hand, Miss Bolo would inquire with a dismal countenance and
reproachful sigh, why Mr. Pickwick had not returned that diamond,
or led the club, or roughed the spade, or finessed the heart, or led
through the honour, or brought out the ace, or played up to the
king, or some such thing; and in reply to all these grave charges,
Mr. Pickwick would be wholly unable to plead any justification
whatever, having by this time forgotten all about the game.
People came and looked on, too, which made Mr. Pickwick nervous.
Besides all this, there was a great deal of distracting conversation
near the table, between Angelo Bantam and the two Miss
Matinters, who, being single and singular, paid great court to the
Master of the Ceremonies, in the hope of getting a stray partner
now and then. All these things, combined with the noises and
interruptions of constant comings in and goings out, made Mr.
Pickwick play rather badly; the cards were against him also; and
when they left off at ten minutes past eleven, Miss Bolo rose from
the table considerably agitated, and went straight home, in a flood
of tears, and a sedan chair.</p>

<p>Being joined by his friends, who one and all protested that they
had scarcely ever spent a more pleasant evening, Mr. Pickwick
accompanied them to the White Hart, and having soothed his
feelings with something hot, went to bed, and to sleep, almost
simultaneously.</p>

</div>

<p class="cap pd15"><span class="upper">As</span> Mr. Pickwick contemplated a stay of at least
two months in Bath, he deemed it advisable to
take private lodgings for himself and friends for
that period; and as a favourable opportunity offered for their
securing, on moderate terms, the upper portion of a house in
the Royal Crescent, which was larger than they required, Mr.
and Mrs. Dowler offered to relieve them of a bedroom and
sitting-room. This proposition was at once accepted, and in three
days&rsquo; time they were all located in their new abode, when Mr.
Pickwick began to drink the waters with the utmost assiduity.
Mr. Pickwick took them systematically. He drank a quarter of a
pint before breakfast, and then walked up a hill; and another
quarter of a pint after breakfast, and then walked down a hill;
and after every fresh quarter of a pint, Mr. Pickwick declared, in
the most solemn and emphatic terms, that he felt a great deal
better: whereat his friends were very much delighted, though they
had not been previously aware that there was anything the matter
with him.</p>

<p>The great pump-room is a spacious saloon, ornamented with
Corinthian pillars, and a music gallery, and a Tompion clock, and
a statue of Nash, and a golden inscription, to which all the water-drinkers
should attend, for it appeals to them in the cause of a
deserving charity. There is a large bar with a marble vase, out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
which the pumper gets the water; and there are a number of
yellow-looking tumblers, out of which the company get it; and
it is a most edifying and satisfactory sight to behold the perseverance
and gravity with which they swallow it. There are baths near
at hand, in which a part of the company wash themselves; and a
band plays afterwards, to congratulate the remainder on their
having done so. There is another pump-room, into which infirm
ladies and gentlemen are wheeled, in such an astonishing variety
of chairs and chaises, that any adventurous individual who goes
in with the regular number of toes, is in imminent danger of coming
out without them; and there is a third, into which the quiet
people go, for it is less noisy than either. There is an immensity
of promenading, on crutches and off, with sticks and without, and
a great deal of conversation, and liveliness, and pleasantry.</p>

<p>Every morning the regular water-drinkers, Mr. Pickwick among
the number, met each other in the pump-room, took their quarter
of a pint, and walked constitutionally. At the afternoon&rsquo;s promenade,
Lord Mutanhed, and the Honourable Mr. Crushton, the
Dowager Lady Snuphanuph, Mrs. Colonel Wugsby, and all the
great people, and all the morning water-drinkers, met in grand
assemblage. After this, they walked out, or drove out, or were
pushed out in bath-chairs, and met one another again. After this,
the gentlemen went to the reading-rooms and met divisions of the
mass. After this, they went home. If it were theatre night,
perhaps they met at the theatre; if it were assembly night, they
met at the rooms; and if it were neither, they met the next day.
A very pleasant routine, with perhaps a slight tinge of sameness.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick was sitting up by himself, after a day spent in
this manner, making entries in his journal: his friends having retired
to bed: when he was roused by a gentle tap at the room door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beg your pardon, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Craddock, the landlady,
peeping in; &ldquo;but did you want anything more, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing more, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My young girl is gone to bed, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Craddock; &ldquo;and
Mr. Dowler is good enough to say that he&rsquo;ll sit up for Mrs. Dowler,
as the party isn&rsquo;t expected to be over till late; so I was thinking if
you wanted nothing more, Mr. Pickwick, I would go to bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;By all means, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wish you good night, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Craddock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good night, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>Mrs. Craddock closed the door, and Mr. Pickwick resumed his
writing.</p>

<p>In half an hour&rsquo;s time the entries were concluded. Mr. Pickwick
carefully rubbed the last page on the blotting paper, shut up
the book, wiped his pen on the bottom of the inside of his coat-tail,
and opened the drawer of the inkstand to put it carefully
away. There were a couple of sheets of writing paper, pretty
closely written over, in the inkstand drawer, and they were folded
so that the title, which was in a good round hand, was fully disclosed
to him. Seeing from this, that it was no private document:
and as it seemed to relate to Bath, and was very short: Mr. Pickwick
unfolded it, lighted his bed-room candle that it might burn up
well by the time he finished; and drawing his chair nearer the fire,
read as follows:</p>


<p class="ttl3">THE TRUE LEGEND OF PRINCE BLADUD</p>

<p>&ldquo;Less than two hundred years agone, on one of the public
baths in this city, there appeared an inscription in honour of its
mighty founder, the renowned Prince Bladud. That inscription
is now erased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For many hundred years before that time, there had been
handed down, from age to age, an old legend, that the illustrious
Prince being afflicted with leprosy, on his return from reaping a
rich harvest of knowledge in Athens, shunned the court of his
royal father, and consorted moodily with husbandmen and pigs.
Among the herd (so said the legend) was a pig of grave and solemn
countenance, with whom the Prince had a fellow feeling&mdash;for he
too was wise&mdash;a pig of thoughtful and reserved demeanour; an
animal superior to his fellows, whose grunt was terrible, and whose
bite was sharp. The young prince sighed deeply as he looked upon
the countenance of the majestic swine; he thought of his royal
father, and his eyes were bedewed with tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This sagacious pig was fond of bathing in rich, moist mud.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Not in summer, as common pigs do now, to cool themselves, and
did even in those distant ages (which is a proof that the light of
civilisation had already begun to dawn, though feebly), but in the
cold sharp days of winter. His coat was ever so sleek, and his
complexion so clear, that the Prince resolved to essay the purifying
qualities of the same water that his friend resorted to. He made
the trial. Beneath that black mud, bubbled the hot springs of
Bath. He washed, and was cured. Hastening to his father&rsquo;s
court, he paid his best respects, and returning quickly hither,
founded this city, and its famous baths.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He sought the pig with all the ardour of their early friendship&mdash;but,
alas! the waters had been his death. He had imprudently
taken a bath at too high a temperature, and the natural
philosopher was no more! He was succeeded by Pliny, who also
fell a victim to his thirst for knowledge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This <em>was</em> the legend. Listen to the true one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A great many centuries since, there flourished in great state,
the famous and renowned Lud Hudibras, King of Britain. He was
a mighty monarch. The earth shook when he walked: he was so
very stout. His people basked in the light of his countenance: it
was so red and glowing. He was, indeed, every inch a king. And
there were a good many inches of him too, for although he was not
very tall, he was a remarkable size round, and the inches that he
wanted in height he made up in circumference. If any degenerate
monarch of modern times could be in any way compared with him,
I should say the venerable King Cole would be that illustrious
potentate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This good king had a queen, who eighteen years before, had
had a son, who was called Bladud. He was sent to a preparatory
seminary in his father&rsquo;s dominions until he was ten years old, and
was then despatched in charge of a trusty messenger, to a finishing
school at Athens; and as there was no extra charge for remaining
during the holidays, and no notice required previous to the removal
of a pupil, there he remained for eight long years, at the expiration
of which time, the king his father sent the Lord Chamberlain over,
to settle the bill, and to bring him home: which, the Lord Chamberlain
doing, was received with shouts, and pensioned immediately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;When King Lud saw the Prince his son, and found he had
grown up such a fine young man, he perceived at once what a
grand thing it would be to have him married without delay, so that
his children might be the means of perpetuating the glorious race
of Lud, down to the very latest ages of the world. With this
view, he sent a special embassy, composed of great noblemen who
had nothing particular to do, and wanted lucrative employment, to
a neighbouring king, and demanded his fair daughter in marriage
for his son: stating at the same time that he was anxious to be on
the most affectionate terms with his brother and friend, but that if
they couldn&rsquo;t agree in arranging this marriage, he should be under
the unpleasant necessity of invading his kingdom, and putting his
eyes out. To this, the other king (who was the weaker of the
two) replied, that he was very much obliged to his friend and
brother for all his goodness and magnanimity, and that his daughter
was quite ready to be married, whenever Prince Bladud liked to
come and fetch her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This answer no sooner reached Britain, than the whole nation
were transported with joy. Nothing was heard, on all sides, but
the sounds of feasting and revelry,&mdash;except the chinking of money
as it was paid in by the people to the collector of the Royal
Treasures, to defray the expenses of the happy ceremony. It was
upon this occasion that King Lud, seated on the top of his throne
in full council, rose, in the exuberance of his feelings, and commanded
the Lord Chief Justice to order in the richest wines and
the court minstrels: an act of graciousness which has been, through
the ignorance of traditionary historians, attributed to King Cole,
in those celebrated lines in which his majesty is represented <span class="nobreak">as&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0c">&lsquo;Calling for his pipe, and calling for his pot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And calling for his fiddlers three.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">Which is an obvious injustice to the memory of King Lud, and a
dishonest exaltation of the virtues of King Cole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But in the midst of all this festivity and rejoicing, there was
one individual present who tasted not when the sparkling wines
were poured forth, and who danced not when the minstrels played.
This was no other than Prince Bladud himself, in honour of whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
happiness a whole people were at that very moment straining alike
their throats and purse-strings. The truth was, that the Prince,
forgetting the undoubted right of the minister for foreign affairs to
fall in love on his behalf, had, contrary to every precedent of policy
and diplomacy, already fallen in love on his own account, and
privately contracted himself unto the fair daughter of a noble
Athenian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here we have a striking example of one of the manifold
advantages of civilisation and refinement. If the Prince had lived
in later days, he might at once have married the object of his
father&rsquo;s choice, and then set himself seriously to work, to relieve
himself of the burden which rested heavily upon him. He might
have endeavoured to break her heart by a systematic course of
insult and neglect; or, if the spirit of her sex, and a proud consciousness
of her many wrongs, had upheld her under this ill
treatment, he might have sought to take her life, and so get rid of
her effectually. But neither mode of relief suggested itself to
Prince Bladud; so he solicited a private audience, and told his
father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is an old prerogative of kings to govern everything but their
passions. King Lud flew into a frightful rage, tossed his crown up
to the ceiling, and caught it again&mdash;for in those days kings kept
their crowns on their heads, and not in the Tower&mdash;stamped the
ground, rapped his forehead, wondered why his own flesh and blood
rebelled against him, and, finally, calling in his guards, ordered the
Prince away to instant confinement in a lofty turret; a course of
treatment which the kings of old very generally pursued towards
their sons, when their matrimonial inclinations did not happen to
point to the same quarter as their own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When Prince Bladud had been shut up in the lofty turret for
the greater part of a year, with no better prospect before his bodily
eyes than a stone wall, or before his mental vision than prolonged
imprisonment, he naturally began to ruminate on a plan of escape,
which, after months of preparation, he managed to accomplish;
considerately leaving his dinner knife in the heart of his gaoler,
lest the poor fellow (who had a family) should be considered privy
to his flight, and punished accordingly by the infuriated king.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The monarch was frantic at the loss of his son. He knew not
on whom to vent his grief and wrath, until fortunately bethinking
himself of the Lord Chamberlain who had brought him home, he
struck off his pension and his head together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile the young Prince, effectually disguised, wandered
on foot through his father&rsquo;s dominions, cheered and supported in
all his hardships by sweet thoughts of the Athenian maid, who was
the innocent cause of his weary trials. One day he stopped to
rest in a country village; and seeing that there were gay dances
going forward on the green, and gay faces passing to and fro, ventured
to inquire of a reveller who stood near him, the reason for
this rejoicing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Know you not, O stranger,&rsquo; was the reply, &lsquo;of the recent
proclamation of our gracious king?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Proclamation! No. What proclamation?&rsquo; rejoined the
Prince&mdash;for he had travelled along the bye and little-frequented
ways and knew nothing of what had passed upon the public roads,
such as they were.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; replied the peasant, &lsquo;the foreign lady that our Prince
wished to wed, is married to a foreign noble of her own country;
and the king proclaims the fact, and a great public festival besides;
for now, of course, Prince Bladud will come back and marry the
lady his father chose, who they say is as beautiful as the noonday
sun. Your health, sir. God save the king!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Prince remained to hear no more. He fled from the spot,
and plunged into the thickest recesses of a neighbouring wood.
On, on, he wandered night and day: beneath the blazing sun,
and the cold pale moon: through the dry heat of noon, and the
damp cold of night: in the grey light of morn, and the red glare
of eve. So heedless was he of time or object, that being bound
for Athens, he wandered as far out of his way as Bath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was no city where Bath stands, then. There was no
vestige of human habitation, or sign of man&rsquo;s resort, to bear the
name; but there was the same noble country, the same broad
expanse of hill and dale, the same beautiful channel stealing on,
far away: the same lofty mountains which, like the troubles of life,
viewed at a distance, and partially obscured by the bright mist of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
its morning, lose their ruggedness and asperity, and seem all ease
and softness. Moved by the gentle beauty of the scene, the Prince
sank upon the green turf, and bathed his swollen feet in his tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said the unhappy Bladud, clasping his hands, and
mournfully raising his eyes towards the sky, &lsquo;would that my wanderings
might end here! Would that these grateful tears, with which
I now mourn hope misplaced, and love despised, might flow in
peace for ever!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wish was heard. It was in the time of the heathen
deities, who used occasionally to take people at their words, with
a promptness, in some cases, extremely awkward. The ground
opened beneath the Prince&rsquo;s feet; he sunk into the chasm; and
instantaneously it closed upon his head for ever, save where his hot
tears welled up through the earth, and where they have continued
to gush forth ever since.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is observable that, to this day, large numbers of elderly
ladies and gentlemen who have been disappointed in procuring
partners, and almost as many young ones who are anxious to obtain
them, repair, annually, to Bath to drink the waters, from which
they derive much strength and comfort. This is most complimentary
to the virtue of Prince Bladud&rsquo;s tears, and strongly corroborative
of the veracity of this legend.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="l4" />

<p>Mr. Pickwick yawned several times, when he had arrived at the
end of this little manuscript: carefully refolded, and replaced it in
the inkstand drawer: and then, with a countenance expressive of
the utmost weariness, lighted his chamber candle, and went upstairs
to bed.</p>

<p>He stopped at Mr. Dowler&rsquo;s door, according to custom, and
knocked to say good night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Dowler, &ldquo;going to bed? I wish I was. Dismal
night. Windy; isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;Good night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick went to his bed-chamber, and Mr. Dowler resumed
his seat before the fire, in fulfilment of his rash promise to
sit up till his wife came home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>There are few things more worrying than sitting up for somebody,
especially if that somebody be at a party. You cannot help
thinking how quickly the time passes with them, which drags so
heavily with you; and the more you think of this, the more your
hopes of their speedy arrival decline. Clocks tick so loud, too,
when you are sitting up alone, and you seem as if you had an
under garment of cobwebs on. First, something tickles your right
knee, and then the same sensation irritates your left. You have no
sooner changed your position than it comes again in the arms;
when you have fidgeted your limbs into all sorts of odd shapes,
you have a sudden relapse in the nose, which you rub as if to rub
it off&mdash;as there is no doubt you would, if you could. Eyes, too,
are mere personal inconveniences; and the wick of one candle gets
an inch and a half long, while you are snuffing the other. These,
and various other little nervous annoyances, render sitting up for a
length of time after everybody else has gone to bed, anything but
a cheerful amusement.</p>

<p>This was just Mr. Dowler&rsquo;s opinion as he sat before the fire, and
felt honestly indignant with all the inhuman people at the party
who were keeping him up. He was not put into better humour
either by the reflection that he had taken it into his head, early in
the evening, to think that he had got an ache there, and so stopped
at home. At length, after several droppings asleep, and fallings
forward towards the bars, and catchings backward soon enough to
prevent being branded in the face, Mr. Dowler made up his mind
that he would throw himself on the bed in the back room and
<em>think</em>&mdash;not sleep, of course.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a heavy sleeper,&rdquo; said Mr. Dowler, as he flung himself on
the bed. &ldquo;I must keep awake. I suppose I shall hear a knock
here. Yes. I thought so. I can hear the watchman. There he
goes. Fainter now, though. A little fainter. He&rsquo;s turning the
corner. Ah!&rdquo; When Mr. Dowler arrived at this point, <em>he</em>
turned the corner at which he had been long hesitating, and fell
fast asleep.</p>

<p>Just as the clock struck three, there was blown into the crescent
a sedan-chair with Mrs. Dowler inside, borne by one short fat chairman,
and one long thin one, who had much ado to keep their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
bodies perpendicular: to say nothing of the chair. But on that
high ground, and in the crescent, which the wind swept round
and round, as if it were going to tear the paving stones up, its fury
was tremendous. They were very glad to set the chair down, and
give a good round loud double-knock at the street door.</p>

<p>They waited some time, but nobody came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Servants is in the arms o&rsquo; Porpus, I think,&rdquo; said the short
chairman, warming his hands at the attendant link-boy&rsquo;s torch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish he&rsquo;d give &rsquo;em a squeeze and wake &rsquo;em,&rdquo; observed the
long one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Knock again, will you, if you please,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Dowler from
the chair. &ldquo;Knock two or three times, if you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The short man was quite willing to get the job over, as soon
as possible; so he stood on the step, and gave four or five most
startling double knocks, of eight or ten knocks a piece: while
the long man went into the road, and looked up at the windows
for a light.</p>

<p>Nobody came. It was all as silent and dark as ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said Mrs. Dowler. &ldquo;You must knock again, if
you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Theer ain&rsquo;t a bell, is there, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; said the short chairman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is,&rdquo; interposed the link-boy, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a ringing at
it ever so long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a handle,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dowler, &ldquo;the wire&rsquo;s broken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish the servants&rsquo; heads wos,&rdquo; growled the long man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must trouble you to knock again, if you please,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Dowler with the utmost politeness.</p>

<p>The short man did knock again several times, without producing
the smallest effect. The tall man, growing very impatient, then
relieved him, and kept on perpetually knocking double knocks of
two loud knocks each, like an insane postman.</p>

<p>At length Mr. Winkle began to dream that he was at a club, and
that the members being very refractory, the chairman was obliged
to hammer the table a good deal to preserve order; then he had a
confused notion of an auction room where there were no bidders,
and the auctioneer was buying everything in; and ultimately he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
began to think it just within the bounds of possibility that somebody
might be knocking at the street door. To make quite certain,
however, he remained quiet in bed for ten minutes or so, and
listened; and when he had counted two or three and thirty knocks,
he felt quite satisfied, and gave himself a great deal of credit for
being so wakeful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rap rap&mdash;rap rap&mdash;rap rap&mdash;ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, rap!&rdquo; went the
knocker.</p>

<p>Mr. Winkle jumped out of bed, wondering very much what
could possibly be the matter, and hastily putting on his stockings
and slippers, folded his dressing-gown round him, lighted a flat
candle from the rushlight that was burning in the fireplace, and
hurried downstairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s somebody comin&rsquo; at last, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the short
chairman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I wos behind him vith a bradawl,&rdquo; muttered the
long one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; cried Mr. Winkle, undoing the chain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop to ask questions, cast-iron head,&rdquo; replied the long
man, with great disgust, taking it for granted that the inquirer was
a footman; &ldquo;but open the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, look sharp, timber eyelids,&rdquo; added the other encouragingly.</p>

<p>Mr. Winkle, being half asleep, obeyed the command mechanically,
opened the door a little, and peeped out. The first thing he
saw, was the red glare of the link-boy&rsquo;s torch. Startled by the
sudden fear that the house might be on fire, he hastily threw the
door wide open, and holding the candle above his head, stared
eagerly before him, not quite certain whether what he saw was a
sedan-chair or a fire-engine. At this instant there came a violent
gust of wind; the light was blown out; Mr. Winkle felt himself
irresistibly impelled on to the steps; and the door blew to, with a
loud crash.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, young man, now you <em>have</em> done it!&rdquo; said the short
chairman.</p>

<p>Mr. Winkle, catching sight of a lady&rsquo;s face at the window of the
sedan, turned hastily round, plied the knocker with all his might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
and main, and called frantically upon the chairman to take the
chair away again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take it away, take it away!&rdquo; cried Mr. Winkle. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
somebody coming out of another house; put me into the chair.
Hide me! Do something with me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this time he was shivering with cold; and every time he
raised his hand to the knocker, the wind took the dressing-gown in
a most unpleasant manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The people are coming down the crescent now. There are
ladies with &rsquo;em; cover me up with something. Stand before
me!&rdquo; roared Mr. Winkle. But the chairmen were too much
exhausted with laughing to afford him the slightest assistance, and
the ladies were every moment approaching nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>Mr. Winkle gave a last hopeless knock; the ladies were only a
few doors off. He threw away the extinguished candle, which, all
this time, he had held above his head, and fairly bolted into the
sedan-chair where Mrs. Dowler was.</p>

<p>Now, Mrs. Craddock had heard the knocking and the voices at
last; and only waiting to put something smarter on her head than
her night-cap, ran down into the front drawing-room to make sure
that it was the right party. Throwing up the window sash as Mr.
Winkle was rushing into the chair, she no sooner caught sight of
what was going forward below, than she raised a vehement and
dismal shriek, and implored Mr. Dowler to get up directly, for his
wife was running away with another gentleman.</p>

<p>Upon this, Mr. Dowler bounced off the bed as abruptly as an
india-rubber ball, and rushing into the front room, arrived at one
window just as Mr. Pickwick threw up the other; when the first
object that met the gaze of both, was Mr. Winkle bolting into the
sedan-chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watchman,&rdquo; shouted Dowler furiously; &ldquo;stop him&mdash;hold
him&mdash;keep him tight&mdash;shut him in, till I come down. I&rsquo;ll cut his
throat&mdash;give me a knife&mdash;from ear to ear, Mrs. Craddock&mdash;I will!&rdquo;
And breaking from the shrieking landlady, and from Mr. Pickwick,
the indignant husband seized a small supper-knife, and tore into
the street.</p>

<p>But Mr. Winkle didn&rsquo;t wait for him. He no sooner heard the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
horrible threat of the valorous Dowler, than he bounced out of the
sedan, quite as quickly as he had bounced in, and throwing off his
slippers into the road, took to his heels and tore round the crescent,
hotly pursued by Dowler and the watchman. He kept ahead; the
door was open as he came round the second time; he rushed in,
slammed it in Dowler&rsquo;s face, mounted to his bed-room, locked the
door, piled a washhand-stand, chest of drawers, and table against
it, and packed up a few necessaries ready for flight with the first
ray of morning.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p>Mr. Winkle took to his heels
and tore round the Crescent.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Dowler came up to the outside of the door; avowed, through
the keyhole, his steadfast determination of cutting Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s
throat next day; and, after a great confusion of voices in the
drawing-room, amidst which that of Mr. Pickwick was distinctly
heard endeavouring to make peace, the inmates dispersed to their
several bed-chambers, and all was quite once more.</p>

<p>It is not unlikely that the inquiry may be made, where Mr.
Weller was, all this time? We will state where he was, in the next
chapter.</p>

<p class="cap pd10"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Mr. Weller</span>,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Craddock,
upon the morning
of this very
eventful day,
&ldquo;here&rsquo;s a letter
for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wery odd that,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afeerd there must be
somethin&rsquo; the matter, for I don&rsquo;t recollect any gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n in my
circle of acquaintance as is capable o&rsquo; writin&rsquo; one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps something uncommon has taken place,&rdquo; observed Mrs.
Craddock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be somethin&rsquo; wery uncommon indeed, as could produce
a letter out o&rsquo; any friend o&rsquo; mine,&rdquo; replied Sam, shaking his head
dubiously; &ldquo;nothin&rsquo; less than a nat&rsquo;ral conwulsion, as the young
gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n observed ven he was took with fits. It can&rsquo;t be from the
gov&rsquo;ner,&rdquo; said Sam, looking at the direction. &ldquo;He always prints, I
know, &rsquo;cos he learnt writin&rsquo; from the large bills in the bookin&rsquo;
offices. It&rsquo;s a wery strange thing now, where this here letter can
ha&rsquo; come from.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Sam said this, he did what a great many people do when
they are uncertain about the writer of a note,&mdash;looked at the seal,
and then at the front, and then at the back, and then at the sides,
and then at the superscription; and, as a last resource, thought
perhaps he might as well look at the inside, and try to find out
from that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wrote on gilt-edged paper,&rdquo; said Sam, as he unfolded it,
&ldquo;and sealed in bronze vax with the top of a door-key. Now for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
it.&rdquo; And, with a very grave face, Mr. Weller slowly read as
follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;A select company of the Bath footmen presents their compliments
to Mr. Weller, and requests the pleasure of his company
this evening, to a friendly swarry, consisting of a boiled leg of
mutton with the usual trimmings. The swarry to be on table at
half-past nine o&rsquo;clock punctually.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was enclosed in another note, which ran <span class="nobreak">thus&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Mr. John Smauker, the gentleman who had the pleasure of
meeting Mr. Weller at the house of their mutual acquaintance, Mr.
Bantam, a few days since, begs to inclose Mr. Weller the herewith
invitation. If Mr. Weller will call on Mr. John Smauker at nine
o&rsquo;clock, Mr. John Smauker will have the pleasure of introducing
Mr. Weller.</p>

<p class="sign">
<span class="sp2">(Signed)</span>      <span class="smcap">John Smauker</span>.&rdquo;
</p>
</div>

<p>The envelope was directed to blank Weller, Esq., at Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s;
and in a parenthesis, in the left-hand corner, were the
words &ldquo;airy bell,&rdquo; as an instruction to the bearer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vell,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;this is comin&rsquo; it rayther powerful, this is. I
never heerd a biled leg of mutton called a swarry afore. I wonder
wot they&rsquo;d call a roast one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, without waiting to debate the point, Sam at once
betook himself into the presence of Mr. Pickwick, and requested
leave of absence for that evening, which was readily granted. With
this permission, and the street-door key, Sam Weller issued forth
a little before the appointed time, and strolled leisurely towards
Queen Square, which he no sooner gained than he had the satisfaction
of beholding Mr. John Smauker leaning his powdered head
against a lamp-post at a short distance off, smoking a cigar through
an amber tube.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Weller?&rdquo; said Mr. John Smauker, raising
his hat gracefully with one hand, while he gently waved the other
in a condescending manner. &ldquo;How do you do, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, reasonably conwalessent,&rdquo; replied Sam. &ldquo;How do <em>you</em>
find yourself, my dear feller?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only so so,&rdquo; said Mr. John Smauker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;ve been a workin&rsquo; too hard,&rdquo; observed Sam. &ldquo;I was
fearful you would; it won&rsquo;t do, you know; you must not give way
to that &rsquo;ere uncompromisin&rsquo; spirit o&rsquo; your&rsquo;n.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so much that, Mr. Weller,&rdquo; replied Mr. John Smauker,
&ldquo;as bad wine; I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve been dissipating.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s it, is it?&rdquo; said Sam; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a wery bad complaint,
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet the temptation, you see, Mr. Weller,&rdquo; observed Mr.
John Smauker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, to be sure,&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plunged into the very vortex of society, you know, Mr.
Weller,&rdquo; said Mr. John Smauker with a sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dreadful indeed!&rdquo; rejoined Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s always the way,&rdquo; said Mr. John Smauker; &ldquo;if your
destiny leads you into public life, and public station, you must
expect to be subjected to temptations which other people is free
from, Mr. Weller.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Precisely what my uncle said, ven <em>he</em> vent into the public line,&rdquo;
remarked Sam, &ldquo;and wery right the old gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n wos, for he
drank hisself to death in somethin&rsquo; less than a quarter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. John Smauker looked deeply indignant at any parallel being
drawn between himself and the deceased gentleman in question;
but as Sam&rsquo;s face was in the most immovable state of calmness, he
thought better of it, and looked affable again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we had better be walking,&rdquo; said Mr. Smauker, consulting
a copper timepiece which dwelt at the bottom of a deep
watch-pocket, and was raised to the surface by means of a black
string, with a copper key at the other end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we had,&rdquo; replied Sam, &ldquo;or they&rsquo;ll overdo the swarry,
and that&rsquo;ll spile it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you drank the waters, Mr. Weller?&rdquo; inquired his companion,
as they walked towards High Street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once,&rdquo; replied Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you think of &rsquo;em, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought they wos particklery unpleasant,&rdquo; replied Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Mr. John Smauker, &ldquo;you disliked the killibeate
taste, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much about that &rsquo;ere,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;I thought
they&rsquo;d a wery strong flavour o&rsquo; warm flat-irons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That <em>is</em> the killibeate, Mr. Weller,&rdquo; observed Mr. John
Smauker, contemptuously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if it is, it&rsquo;s a wery inexpressive word, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said
Sam. &ldquo;It may be, but I ain&rsquo;t much in the chimical line myself, so
I can&rsquo;t say.&rdquo; And here, to the great horror of Mr. John Smauker,
Sam Weller began to whistle.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="color05"></a>
<img src="images/color05.jpg" width="628" height="460" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>And here, to the great horror
of Mr. John Smauker, Sam
Weller began to whistle.</p>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, Mr. Weller,&rdquo; said Mr. John Smauker,
agonised at the exceedingly ungenteel sound, &ldquo;will you take
my arm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thankee, you&rsquo;re wery good, but I won&rsquo;t deprive you of it,&rdquo;
replied Sam. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve rayther a way o&rsquo; puttin&rsquo; my hands in my
pockets, if it&rsquo;s all the same to you.&rdquo; As Sam said this, he suited
the action to the word, and whistled far louder than before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This way,&rdquo; said his new friend, apparently much relieved as
they turned down a by-street; &ldquo;we shall soon be there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we?&rdquo; said Sam, quite unmoved by the announcement of
his close vicinity to the select footmen of Bath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. John Smauker. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed, Mr.
Weller.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see very handsome uniforms, Mr. Weller,&rdquo; continued
Mr. John Smauker; &ldquo;and perhaps you&rsquo;ll find some of the
gentlemen rather high at first, you know, but they&rsquo;ll soon come
round.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s wery kind on &rsquo;em,&rdquo; replied Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you know,&rdquo; resumed Mr. John Smauker, with an air of
sublime protection; &ldquo;you know, as you&rsquo;re a stranger, perhaps
they&rsquo;ll be rather hard upon you at first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t be wery cruel, though, will they?&rdquo; inquired Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied Mr. John Smauker, pulling forth the fox&rsquo;s
head and taking a gentlemanly pinch. &ldquo;There are some funny
dogs among us, and they will have their joke, you know: but you
mustn&rsquo;t mind &rsquo;em, you mustn&rsquo;t mind &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try and bear up agin such a reg&rsquo;lar knock-down o&rsquo; talent,&rdquo;
replied Sam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Mr. John Smauker, putting up the fox&rsquo;s
head and elevating his own; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stand by you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time they had reached a small greengrocer&rsquo;s shop,
which Mr. John Smauker entered, followed by Sam: who, the
moment he got behind him, relapsed into a series of the very
broadest and most unmitigated grins, and manifested other demonstrations
of being in a highly enviable state of inward merriment.</p>

<p>Crossing the greengrocer&rsquo;s shop, and putting their hats on the
stairs in the little passage behind it, they walked into a small
parlour; and here the full splendour of the scene burst upon Mr.
Weller&rsquo;s view.</p>

<p>A couple of tables were put together in the middle of the
parlour, covered with three or four cloths of different ages and
dates of washing, arranged to look as much like one as the circumstances
of the case would allow. Upon these were laid knives
and forks for six or eight people. Some of the knife handles were
green, others red, and a few yellow; and as all the forks were
black, the combination of colours was exceedingly striking. Plates
for a corresponding number of guests were warming behind the
fender; and the guests themselves were warming before it: the
chief and most important of whom appeared to be a stoutish
gentleman in a bright crimson coat with long tails, vividly red
breeches, and a cocked hat, who was standing with his back to the
fire and had apparently just entered, for besides retaining his
cocked hat on his head, he carried in his hand a high stick, such
as gentlemen of his profession usually elevate in a sloping position
over the roofs of carriages.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Smauker, my lad, your fin,&rdquo; said the gentleman with the
cocked hat.</p>

<p>Mr. Smauker dovetailed the top joint of his right-hand little
finger into that of the gentleman with the cocked hat and said
he was charmed to see him looking so well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, they tell me I am looking pretty blooming,&rdquo; said the
man with the cocked hat, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s a wonder, too. I&rsquo;ve been following
our old woman about, two hours a day, for the last fortnight;
and if a constant contemplation of the manner in which she hooks-and-eyes
that infernal old lavender-coloured gown of hers behind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
isn&rsquo;t enough to throw anybody into a low state of despondency for
life, stop my quarter&rsquo;s salary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this, the assembled selections laughed very heartily; and one
gentleman in a yellow waistcoat, with a coach-trimming border,
whispered a neighbour in green-foil smalls, that Tuckle was in
spirits to-night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By-the-bye,&rdquo; said Mr. Tuckle, &ldquo;Smauker, my boy, you&mdash;&rdquo;
The remainder of the sentence was forwarded into Mr. John
Smauker&rsquo;s ear, by whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear me, I quite forgot,&rdquo; said Mr. John Smauker.
&ldquo;Gentlemen, my friend Mr. Weller.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry to keep the fire off you, Weller,&rdquo; said Mr. Tuckle, with
a familiar nod. &ldquo;Hope you&rsquo;re not cold, Weller?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not by no means, Blazes,&rdquo; replied Sam. &ldquo;It &rsquo;ud be a wery
chilly subject as felt cold ven you stood opposit. You&rsquo;d save coals
if they put you behind the fender in the waitin&rsquo; room at a public
office, you would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As this retort appeared to convey rather a personal allusion to
Mr. Tuckle&rsquo;s crimson livery, that gentleman looked majestic for a
few seconds, but gradually edging away from the fire, broke into
a forced smile, and said it wasn&rsquo;t bad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wery much obliged for your good opinion, sir,&rdquo; replied Sam.
&ldquo;We shall get on by degrees, I des-say. We&rsquo;ll try a better one,
by-and-by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this point the conversation was interrupted by the arrival
of a gentleman in orange-coloured plush, accompanied by another
selection in purple cloth, with a great extent of stocking. The
new comers having been welcomed by the old ones, Mr. Tuckle
put the question that supper be ordered in, which was carried
unanimously.</p>

<p>The greengrocer and his wife then arranged upon the table a
boiled leg of mutton, hot, with caper sauce, turnips, and potatoes.
Mr. Tuckle took the chair, and was supported at the other end of
the board by the gentleman in orange plush. The greengrocer put
on a pair of wash-leather gloves to hand the plates with, and
stationed himself behind Mr. Tuckle&rsquo;s chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Harris,&rdquo; said Mr. Tuckle in a commanding tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir?&rdquo; said the greengrocer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you got your gloves on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then take the kiver off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The greengrocer did as he was told, with a show of great
humility, and obsequiously handed Mr. Tuckle the carving knife;
in doing which, he accidentally gaped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that, sir?&rdquo; said Mr. Tuckle, with great
asperity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rdquo; replied the crestfallen greengrocer,
&ldquo;I din&rsquo;t mean to do it, sir; I was up very late last night, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you what my opinion of you is, Harris,&rdquo; said Mr. Tuckle
with a most impressive air, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a wulgar beast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Harris, &ldquo;that you won&rsquo;t be severe
with me, gentlemen. I&rsquo;m very much obliged to you indeed,
gentlemen, for your patronage, and also for your recommendations,
gentlemen, whenever additional assistance in waiting is required.
I hope, gentlemen, I give satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Tuckle. &ldquo;Very far from
it, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We consider you an inattentive reskel,&rdquo; said the gentleman in
the orange plush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a low thief,&rdquo; added the gentleman in the green-foil
smalls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And an unreclaimable blaygaird,&rdquo; added the gentleman in
purple.</p>

<p>The poor greengrocer bowed very humbly while these little
epithets were bestowed upon him, in the true spirit of the very
smallest tyranny; and when everybody had said something to show
his superiority, Mr. Tuckle proceeded to carve the leg of mutton,
and to help the company.</p>

<p>This important business of the evening had hardly commenced,
when the door was thrown briskly open, and another gentleman
in a light blue suit, and leaden buttons, made his appearance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Against the rules,&rdquo; said Mr. Tuckle. &ldquo;Too late, too late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no; positively I couldn&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; said the gentleman in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
blue. &ldquo;I appeal to the company. An affair of gallantry now, an
appointment at the theayter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that indeed,&rdquo; said the gentleman in the orange plush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; raly now, honour bright,&rdquo; said the man in blue. &ldquo;I
made a promese to fetch our youngest daughter at half-past ten,
and she is such an uncauminly fine gal, that I raly hadn&rsquo;t the art
to disappoint her. No offence to the present company, sir, but
a petticut, sir, a petticut, sir, is irrevokeable!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I begin to suspect there&rsquo;s something in that quarter,&rdquo; said
Tuckle, as the new-comer took his seat next Sam. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve remarked
once or twice, that she leans very heavy on your shoulder, when
she gets in and out of the carriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh raly, raly, Tuckle, you shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the man in blue.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair. I may have said to one or two friends that she was
a very divine creechure, and had refused one or two offers without
any hobvus cause, but&mdash;no, no, no, indeed, Tuckle&mdash;before
strangers too&mdash;it&rsquo;s not right&mdash;you shouldn&rsquo;t. Delicacy, my dear
friend, delicacy!&rdquo; And the man in blue, pulling up his neckerchief,
and adjusting his coat cuffs, nodded and frowned as if there
were more behind, which he could say if he liked, but was bound
in honour to suppress.</p>

<p>The man in blue being a light-haired, stiff-necked, free and easy
sort of footman, with a swaggering air and pert face, had attracted
Mr. Weller&rsquo;s especial attention at first, but when he began to come
out in this way, Sam felt more than ever disposed to cultivate his
acquaintance; so he launched himself into the conversation at once,
with characteristic independence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your health, sir,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;I like you conwersation much.
I think it&rsquo;s wery pretty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this the man in blue smiled, as if it were a compliment he
was well used to; but looked approvingly on Sam at the same
time, and said he hoped he should be better acquainted with him,
for without any flattery at all, he seemed to have the makings of
a very nice fellow about him, and to be just the man after his
own heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wery good, sir,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;What a lucky feller
you are!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; inquired the gentleman in blue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That &rsquo;ere young lady,&rdquo; replied Sam. &ldquo;She knows wot&rsquo;s wot,
she does. Ah! I see.&rdquo; Mr. Weller closed one eye, and shook his
head from side to side, in a manner which was highly gratifying to
the personal vanity of the gentleman in blue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re a cunning fellow, Mr. Weller,&rdquo; said that
individual.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;I leave all that &rsquo;ere to you. It&rsquo;s a great
deal more in your way than mine, as the gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n on the right side
o&rsquo; the garden vall said to the man on the wrong &rsquo;un, ven the mad
bull wos a comin&rsquo; up the lane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, Mr. Weller,&rdquo; said the gentleman in blue, &ldquo;I think
she has remarked my air and manner, Mr. Weller.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think she couldn&rsquo;t wery vell be off o&rsquo; that,&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any little thing of that kind in hand, sir?&rdquo; inquired
the favoured gentleman in blue, drawing a toothpick from his
waistcoat pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no daughters at my place,
else o&rsquo; course I should ha&rsquo; made up to vun on &rsquo;em. As it is, I don&rsquo;t
think I can do anything under a female markis. I might take
up vith a young &rsquo;ooman o&rsquo; large property, as hadn&rsquo;t a title, if she
made wery fierce love to me. Not else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not, Mr. Weller,&rdquo; said the gentleman in blue, &ldquo;one
can&rsquo;t be troubled, you know; and <em>we</em> know, Mr. Weller&mdash;we, who
are men of the world&mdash;that a good uniform must work its way with
the women, sooner or later. In fact, that&rsquo;s the only thing, between
you and me, that makes the service worth entering into.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, o&rsquo; course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When this confidential dialogue had gone thus far, glasses were
placed round, and every gentleman ordered what he liked best,
before the public-house shut up. The gentleman in blue, and the
man in orange, who were the chief exquisites of the party, ordered
&ldquo;cold scrub and water,&rdquo; but with the others, gin and water, sweet,
appeared to be the favourite beverage. Sam called the greengrocer
a &ldquo;desp&rsquo;rate willin,&rdquo; and ordered a large bowl of punch: two
circumstances which seemed to raise him very much in the opinion
of the selections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said the man in blue, with an air of the most
consummate dandyism, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you &lsquo;The ladies&rsquo;; come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;The young mississes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here there was a loud cry of &ldquo;Order,&rdquo; and Mr. John Smauker,
as the gentleman who had introduced Mr. Weller into that company,
begged to inform him that the word he had just made use of
was unparliamentary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which word was that &rsquo;ere, sir?&rdquo; inquired Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Missesses, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. John Smauker, with an alarming
frown. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t recognise such distinctions here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, wery good,&rdquo; said Sam; &ldquo;then I&rsquo;ll amend the observation,
and call &rsquo;em the dear creeturs, if Blazes vill allow me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some doubt appeared to exist in the mind of the gentleman
in the green-foil smalls, whether the chairman could be legally
appealed to, as &ldquo;Blazes,&rdquo; but as the company seemed more disposed
to stand upon their own rights than his, the question was not
raised. The man with the cocked hat breathed short, and looked
long at Sam, but apparently thought it as well to say nothing, in
case he should get the worst of it.</p>

<p>After a short silence, a gentleman in an embroidered coat
reaching down to his heels, and a waistcoat of the same which kept
one half of his legs warm, stirred his gin and water with great
energy, and putting himself upon his feet, all at once, by a violent
effort, said he was desirous of offering a few remarks to the company:
whereupon the person in the cocked hat had no doubt that the
company would be very happy to hear any remarks that the man
in the long coat might wish to offer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel a great delicacy, gentlemen, in coming for&rsquo;ard,&rdquo; said the
man in the long coat, &ldquo;having the misforchune to be a coachman,
and being admitted as a honorary member of these agreeable
swarrys, but I do feel myself bound, gentlemen&mdash;drove into a
corner, if I may use the expression&mdash;to make known an afflicting
circumstance which has come to my knowledge; which has happened
I may say within the soap of my everyday contemplation.
Gentlemen, our friend Mr. Whiffers (everybody looked at the
individual in orange), our friend Mr. Whiffers has resigned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Universal astonishment fell upon the hearers. Each gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
looked in his neighbour&rsquo;s face, and then transferred his glance to
the upstanding coachman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may well be sapparised, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the coachman.
&ldquo;I will not wenchure to state the reasons of this irrepairabel loss to
the service, but I will beg Mr. Whiffers to state them himself, for
the improvement and imitation of his admiring friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The suggestion being loudly approved of, Mr. Whiffers explained.
He said he certainly could have wished to have continued
to hold the appointment he had just resigned. The uniform was
extremely rich and expensive, the females of the family was most
agreeable, and the duties of the situation was not, he was bound to
say, too heavy: the principal service that was required of him,
being, that he should look out of the hall window as much as
possible, in company with another gentleman, who had also resigned.
He could have wished to have spared that company the
painful and disgusting detail on which he was about to enter, but
as the explanation had been demanded of him, he had no alternative
but to state, boldly and distinctly, that he had been required
to eat cold meat.</p>

<p>It is impossible to conceive the disgust which this avowal
awakened in the bosoms of the hearers. Loud cries of &ldquo;Shame!&rdquo;
mingled with groans and hisses, prevailed for a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. Whiffers then added that he feared a portion of this outrage
might be traced to his own forbearing and accommodating disposition.
He had a distinct recollection of having once consented
to eat salt butter, and he had, moreover, on an occasion of sudden
sickness in the house, so far forgotten himself as to carry a coal-scuttle
up to the second floor. He trusted he had not lowered
himself in the good opinion of his friends by this frank confession
of his faults; and he hoped the promptness with which he had
resented the last unmanly outrage on his feelings, to which he
had referred, would reinstate him in their good opinion, if he had.</p>

<p>Mr. Whiffers&rsquo; address was responded to with a shout of admiration,
and the health of the interesting martyr was drunk in a most
enthusiastic manner; for this, the martyr returned thanks, and
proposed their visitor, Mr. Weller; a gentleman whom he had
not the pleasure of an intimate acquaintance with, but who was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
friend of Mr. John Smauker, which was a sufficient letter of recommendation
to any society of gentlemen whatever, or wherever.
On this account, he should have been disposed to have given Mr.
Weller&rsquo;s health with all the honours, if his friends had been drinking
wine; but as they were taking spirits by way of a change, and as
it might be inconvenient to empty a tumbler at every toast, he
should propose that the honours be understood.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of this speech, everybody took a sip in honour
of Sam; and Sam having ladled out, and drunk, two full glasses of
punch in honour of himself, returned thanks in a neat speech.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wery much obliged to you, old fellers,&rdquo; said Sam, ladling
away at the punch in the most unembarrassed manner possible, &ldquo;for
this here compliment; wich, comin&rsquo; from sich a quarter, is wery
overvelmin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ve heerd a good deal on you as a body, but I will
say, that I never thought you was sich uncommon nice men as I find
you air. I only hope you&rsquo;ll take care o&rsquo; yourselves, and not compromise
nothin&rsquo; o&rsquo; your dignity, which is a wery charmin&rsquo; thing to
see, when one&rsquo;s out a walkin&rsquo;, and has always made me wery happy
to look at, ever since I was a boy about half as high as the brass-headed
stick o&rsquo; my wery respectable friend, Blazes, there. As to
the wictim of oppression in the suit o&rsquo; brimstone, all I can say of
him, is, that I hope he&rsquo;ll get jist as good a berth as he deserves:
in vich case it&rsquo;s wery little cold swarry as ever he&rsquo;ll be troubled
with agin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Sam sat down with a pleasant smile, and his speech having
been vociferously applauded, the company broke up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vy, you don&rsquo;t mean to say you&rsquo;re a goin&rsquo;, old feller?&rdquo; said
Sam Weller to his friend Mr. John Smauker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must indeed,&rdquo; said Mr. Smauker; &ldquo;I promised Bantam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, wery well,&rdquo; said Sam; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s another thing. P&rsquo;raps
<em>he&rsquo;d</em> resign if you disappointed him. You ain&rsquo;t a goin&rsquo;, Blazes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; said the man with the cocked hat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot, and leave three quarters of a bowl of punch behind you!&rdquo;
said Sam; &ldquo;nonsense, set down agin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Tuckle was not proof against this invitation. He laid aside
the cocked hat and stick which he had just taken up, and said he
would have one glass, for good fellowship&rsquo;s sake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>As the gentleman in blue went home the same way as Mr.
Tuckle, he was prevailed upon to stop too. When the punch was
about half gone, Sam ordered in some oysters from the greengrocer&rsquo;s
shop; and the effect of both was so extremely exhilarating,
that Mr. Tuckle, dressed out with the cocked hat and stick,
danced the frog hornpipe among the shells on the table; while
the gentleman in blue played an accompaniment upon an ingenious
musical instrument formed of a hair-comb and a curl-paper. At
last, when the punch was all gone, and the night nearly so, they
sallied forth to see each other home. Mr. Tuckle no sooner got
into the open air, than he was seized with a sudden desire to lie
on the curb-stone; Sam thought it would be a pity to contradict
him, and so let him have his own way. As the cocked hat would have
been spoilt if left there, Sam very considerately flattened it down
on the head of the gentleman in blue, and putting the big stick
in his hand, propped him up against his own street door, rang the
bell, and walked quietly home.</p>

<p>At a much earlier hour next morning than his usual time of
rising, Mr. Pickwick walked down-stairs completely dressed and
rang the bell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, when Mr. Weller appeared in reply
to the summons, &ldquo;shut the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Weller did so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was an unfortunate occurrence here last night, Sam,&rdquo;
said Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;which gave Mr. Winkle some cause to apprehend
violence from Mr. Dowler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve heerd from the old lady down-stairs, sir,&rdquo; replied Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sorry to say, Sam,&rdquo; continued Mr. Pickwick, with a
most perplexed countenance, &ldquo;that in dread of this violence, Mr.
Winkle has gone away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone avay!&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Left the house early this morning, without the slightest
previous communication with me,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;And
is gone, I know not where.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He should ha&rsquo; stopped and fought it out, sir,&rdquo; replied Sam,
contemptuously. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t take much to settle that &rsquo;ere
Dowler, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;I may have my doubts of his
great bravery and determination, also. But, however that may be,
Mr. Winkle is gone. He must be found, Sam. Found and
brought back to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And s&rsquo;pose he won&rsquo;t come back, sir?&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must be made, Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s to do it, sir?&rdquo; inquired Sam, with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wery good, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With these words Mr. Weller left the room, and immediately
afterwards was heard to shut the street door. In two hours&rsquo; time
he returned with as much coolness as if he had been despatched
on the most ordinary message possible, and brought the information
that an individual, in every respect answering Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s description,
had gone over to Bristol that morning, by the branch coach
from the Royal Hotel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, grasping his hand, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a capital
fellow; an invaluable fellow. You must follow him, Sam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cert&rsquo;nly, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The instant you discover him, write to me immediately, Sam,&rdquo;
said Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;If he attempts to run away from you, knock
him down, or lock him up. You have my full authority, Sam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be wery careful, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll tell him,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;that I am highly excited,
highly displeased, and naturally indignant, at the very extraordinary
course he has thought proper to pursue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will, sir,&rdquo; replied Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll tell him,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;that if he does not come
back to this very house, with you, he will come back with me, for I
will come and fetch him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll mention that &rsquo;ere, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think you can find him, Sam?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick,
looking earnestly in his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll find him, if he&rsquo;s anyvere,&rdquo; rejoined Sam, with great
confidence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;Then the sooner you go
the better.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>With these instructions Mr. Pickwick placed a sum of money
in the hands of his faithful servitor, and ordered him to start for
Bristol immediately, in pursuit of the fugitive.</p>

<p>Sam put a few necessaries in a carpet bag, and was ready for
starting. He stopped when he had got to the end of the passage,
and walking quietly back, thrust his head in at the parlour door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; whispered Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Sam?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fully understands my instructions, do I, sir?&rdquo; inquired
Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s reg&rsquo;larly understood about the knockin&rsquo; down, is it, sir?&rdquo;
inquired Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;Thoroughly. Do what
you think necessary. You have my orders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam gave a nod of intelligence, and withdrawing his head from
the door, set forth on his pilgrimage with a light heart.</p>

<p class="cap pd10"><span class="upper">The</span> ill-starred gentleman who had been the unfortunate
cause of the unusual noise and disturbance
which alarmed the inhabitants of the Royal
Crescent in manner and form already described,
after passing a night of great confusion and anxiety,
left the roof beneath which his friends still slumbered,
bound he knew not whither. The excellent and considerate
feelings which prompted Mr. Winkle to take this step
can never be too highly appreciated or too warmly extolled.
&ldquo;If,&rdquo; reasoned Mr. Winkle with himself, &ldquo;if this Dowler
attempts (as I have no doubt he will) to carry into execution
his threat of personal violence against myself, it will be incumbent
on me to call him out. He has a wife; that wife is
attached to and dependent on him. Heavens! If I should kill
him in the blindness of my wrath, what would be my feelings ever
afterwards!&rdquo; This painful consideration operated so powerfully on
the feelings of the humane young man, as to cause his knees to
knock together, and his countenance to exhibit alarming manifestations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
of inward emotion. Impelled by such reflections, he
grasped his carpet bag, and creeping stealthily down-stairs, shut
the detestable street door with as little noise as possible, and walked
off. Bending his steps towards the Royal Hotel, he found a coach
on the point of starting for Bristol, and, thinking Bristol as good a
place for his purpose as any other he could go to, he mounted the
box, and reached the place of destination in such time as the pair
of horses, who went the whole stage and back again twice a day or
more, could be reasonably supposed to arrive there.</p>

<p>He took up his quarters at The Bush, and, designing to postpone
any communication by letter with Mr. Pickwick until it was
probable that Mr. Dowler&rsquo;s wrath might have in some degree
evaporated, walked forth to view the city, which struck him as being
a shade more dirty than any place he had ever seen. Having inspected
the docks and shipping, and viewed the cathedral, he
inquired his way to Clifton, and being directed thither, took the
route which was pointed out to him. But, as the pavements of
Bristol are not the widest or cleanest upon earth, so its streets are
not altogether the straightest or least intricate; Mr. Winkle being
greatly puzzled by their manifold windings and twistings, looked
about him for a decent shop, in which he could apply afresh for
counsel and instruction.</p>

<p>His eyes fell upon a newly-painted tenement which had been
recently converted into something between a shop and a private
house, and which a red lamp, projecting over the fanlight of the
street-door, would have sufficiently announced as the residence of
a medical practitioner, even if the word &ldquo;Surgery&rdquo; had not been
inscribed in golden characters on a wainscot ground, above the
window of what, in times bygone, had been the front parlour.
Thinking this an eligible place wherein to make his inquiries, Mr.
Winkle stepped into the little shop where the gilt-labelled drawers
and bottles were; and finding nobody there, knocked with a half-crown
on the counter, to attract the attention of anybody who
might happen to be in the back parlour, which he judged to be the
innermost and peculiar sanctum of the establishment, from the
repetition of the word &ldquo;Surgery&rdquo; on the door&mdash;painted in white
letters this time, by way of taking off the monotony.</p>

<p>At the first knock, a sound, as of persons fencing with fire-irons,
which had until now been very audible, suddenly ceased; at
the second, a studious-looking young gentleman in green spectacles,
with a very large book in his hand, glided quietly into the shop, and
stepping behind the counter, requested to know the visitor&rsquo;s pleasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to trouble you, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Winkle, &ldquo;but will
you have the goodness to direct me <span class="nobreak">to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo; roared the studious young gentleman, throwing
the large book up into the air, and catching it with great
dexterity at the very moment when it threatened to smash to atoms
all the bottles on the counter. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a start!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was, without a doubt; for Mr. Winkle was so very much
astonished at the extraordinary behaviour of the medical gentleman,
that he involuntarily retreated towards the door, and looked
very much disturbed at this strange reception.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo; said the medical gentleman.</p>

<p>Mr. Winkle murmured, in reply, that he had not that pleasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, then,&rdquo; said the medical gentleman, &ldquo;there are hopes for
me yet; I may attend half the old women in Bristol if I&rsquo;ve decent
luck. Get out, you mouldy old villain, get out!&rdquo; With this
adjuration, which was addressed to the large book, the medical
gentleman kicked the volume with remarkable agility to the further
end of the shop, and, pulling off his green spectacles, grinned the
identical grin of Robert Sawyer, Esquire, formerly of Guy&rsquo;s
Hospital in the Borough, with a private residence in Lant Street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you weren&rsquo;t down upon me!&rdquo; said
Mr. Bob Sawyer, shaking Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s hand with friendly warmth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my word I was not,&rdquo; replied Mr. Winkle, returning
the pressure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder you didn&rsquo;t see the name,&rdquo; said Bob Sawyer, calling
his friend&rsquo;s attention to the outer door, on which, in the same white
paint, were traced the words, &ldquo;Sawyer, late Nockemorf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It never caught my eye,&rdquo; returned Mr. Winkle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord, if I had known who you were, I should have rushed out,
and caught you in my arms,&rdquo; said Bob Sawyer; &ldquo;but upon my
life, I thought you were the King&rsquo;s-taxes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Mr. Winkle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I did, indeed,&rdquo; responded Bob Sawyer, &ldquo;and I was just going
to say that I wasn&rsquo;t at home, but if you&rsquo;d leave a message I&rsquo;d be sure
to give it to myself; for he don&rsquo;t know me; no more does the
Lighting and Paving. I think the Church-rates guesses who I am,
and I know the Water-works does, because I drew a tooth of his
when I first came down here. But come in, come in!&rdquo; Chattering
in this way, Mr. Bob Sawyer pushed Mr. Winkle into the back
room, where, amusing himself by boring little circular caverns in
the chimney-piece with a red-hot poker, sat no less a person than
Mr. Benjamin Allen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Mr. Winkle. &ldquo;This is indeed a pleasure I did not
expect. What a very nice place you have here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty well, pretty well,&rdquo; replied Bob Sawyer. &ldquo;I <em>passed</em> soon
after the precious party, and my friends came down with the needful
for this business; so I put on a black suit of clothes, and a pair of
spectacles, and came here to look as solemn as I could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a very snug little business you have, no doubt?&rdquo; said
Mr. Winkle, knowingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; replied Bob Sawyer. &ldquo;So snug, that at the end of a
few years you might put all the profits in a wine-glass, and cover
&rsquo;em over with a gooseberry leaf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot surely mean that?&rdquo; said Mr. Winkle. &ldquo;The
stock <span class="nobreak">itself&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Dummies, my dear boy,&rdquo; said Bob Sawyer; &ldquo;half the drawers
have nothing in &rsquo;em, and the other half don&rsquo;t open.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Mr. Winkle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fact&mdash;honour!&rdquo; returned Bob Sawyer, stepping out into the
shop, and demonstrating the veracity of the assertion by divers
hard pulls at the little gilt knobs on the counterfeit drawers.
&ldquo;Hardly anything real in the shop but the leeches, and <em>they</em> are
second-hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have thought it!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Winkle, much
surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; replied Bob Sawyer, &ldquo;else where&rsquo;s the use of
appearances, eh? But what will you take? Do as we do? That&rsquo;s
right. Ben, my fine fellow, put your hand into the cupboard, and
bring out the patent digester.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Benjamin Allen smiled his readiness, and produced from the
closet at his elbow a black bottle half full of brandy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t take water, of course?&rdquo; said Bob Sawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; replied Mr. Winkle. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather early. I should
like to qualify it, if you have no objection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None in the least, if you can reconcile it to your conscience,&rdquo;
replied Bob Sawyer; tossing off, as he spoke, a glass of the liquor
with great relish. &ldquo;Ben, the pipkin!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Benjamin Allen drew forth, from the same hiding-place, a
small brass pipkin, which Bob Sawyer observed he prided himself
upon particularly, because it looked so business-like. The water
in the professional pipkin having been made to boil, in course of
time, by various little shovelsful of coal, which Mr. Bob Sawyer
took out of a practicable window-seat, labelled &ldquo;Soda Water,&rdquo; Mr.
Winkle adulterated his brandy; and the conversation was becoming
general, when it was interrupted by the entrance into the shop
of a boy, in a sober grey livery and a gold-laced hat, with a small
covered basket under his arm: whom Mr. Bob Sawyer immediately
hailed with, &ldquo;Tom, you vagabond, come here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy presented himself accordingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been stopping to over all the posts in Bristol, you idle
young scamp!&rdquo; said Mr. Bob Sawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better not!&rdquo; said Mr. Bob Sawyer, with a threatening
aspect. &ldquo;Who do you suppose will ever employ a professional
man, when they see his boy playing at marbles in the gutter, or
flying the garter in the horse-road? Have you no feeling for your
profession, you groveller? Did you leave all the medicine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The powders for the child, at the large house with the new
family, and the pills to be taken four times a day at the ill-tempered
old gentleman&rsquo;s with the gouty leg?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then shut the door, and mind the shop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Mr. Winkle, as the boy retired, &ldquo;things are not
quite so bad as you would have me believe, either. There is <em>some</em>
medicine to be sent out.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Bob Sawyer peeped out the shop to see that no stranger
was within hearing, and leaning forward to Mr. Winkle, said, in a
low tone:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He leaves it all at the wrong houses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Winkle looked perplexed, and Bob Sawyer and his friend
laughed.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="ill06"></a>

<div class="caption">
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been stopping to over all the posts in Bristol&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;He goes up to a house, rings the
area bell, pokes a packet of medicine without a direction into the
servant&rsquo;s hand, and walks off. Servant takes it into the dining-parlour;
master open it, and reads the label: &lsquo;Draught to be
taken at bed-time&mdash;pills as before&mdash;lotion as usual&mdash;<em>the</em> powder.
From Sawyer&rsquo;s, late Nockemorf&rsquo;s. Physicians&rsquo; prescriptions carefully
prepared,&rsquo; and all the rest of it. Shows it to his wife&mdash;<em>she</em>
reads the label; it goes down to the servants&mdash;<em>they</em> read the label.
Next day, boy calls: &lsquo;Very sorry&mdash;his mistake&mdash;immense business&mdash;great
many parcels to deliver&mdash;Mr. Sawyer&rsquo;s compliments&mdash;late
Nockemorf.&rsquo; The name gets known, and that&rsquo;s the thing, my boy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
in the medical way. Bless your heart, old fellow, it&rsquo;s better than
all the advertising in the world. We have got one four-ounce
bottle that&rsquo;s been to half the houses in Bristol, and hasn&rsquo;t done yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me, I see,&rdquo; observed Mr. Winkle; &ldquo;what an excellent
plan!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ben and I have hit upon a dozen such,&rdquo; replied Bob
Sawyer with great glee. &ldquo;The lamplighter has eighteenpence a
week to pull the night-bell for ten minutes every time he comes
round; and my boy always rushes into church, just before the
psalms, when the people have got nothing to do but look about
&rsquo;em, and calls me out, with horror and dismay depicted on his
countenance. &lsquo;Bless my soul,&rsquo; everybody says, &lsquo;somebody taken
suddenly ill! Sawyer, late Nockemorf, sent for. What a business
that young man has!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the termination of this disclosure of some of the mysteries
of medicine, Mr. Bob Sawyer and his friend, Ben Allen, threw
themselves back in their respective chairs, and laughed boisterously.
When they had enjoyed the joke to their hearts&rsquo; content, the
discourse changed to topics in which Mr. Winkle was more
immediately interested.</p>

<p>We think we have hinted elsewhere, that Mr. Benjamin Allen
had a way of becoming sentimental after brandy. The case is not
a peculiar one, as we ourselves can testify: having, on a few occasions,
had to deal with patients who have been afflicted in a similar
manner. At this precise period of his existence, Mr. Benjamin
Allen had perhaps a greater predisposition to maudlinism than he
had ever known before; the cause of which malady was briefly this.
He had been staying nearly three weeks with Mr. Bob Sawyer;
Mr. Bob Sawyer was not remarkable for temperance, nor was Mr.
Benjamin Allen for the ownership of a very strong head; the
consequence was, that, during the whole space of time just mentioned,
Mr. Benjamin Allen had been wavering between intoxication
partial, and intoxication complete.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; said Mr. Ben Allen, taking advantage of Mr.
Bob Sawyer&rsquo;s temporary absence behind the counter, whither he
had retired to dispense some of the second-hand leeches, previously
referred to: &ldquo;my dear friend, I am very miserable.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Winkle professed his heartfelt regret to hear it, and begged
to know whether he could do anything to alleviate the sorrows of
the suffering student.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, my dear boy, nothing,&rdquo; said Ben. &ldquo;You recollect
Arabella, Winkle? My sister Arabella&mdash;a little girl, Winkle, with
black eyes&mdash;when we were down at Wardle&rsquo;s? I don&rsquo;t know
whether you happened to notice her, a nice little girl, Winkle.
Perhaps my features may recall her countenance to your recollection?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Winkle required nothing to recall the charming Arabella
to his mind; and it was rather fortunate he did not, for the features
of her brother Benjamin would unquestionably have proved but an
indifferent refresher to his memory. He answered, with as much
calmness as he could assume, that he perfectly remembered the
young lady referred to, and sincerely trusted she was in good health.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our friend Bob is a delightful fellow, Winkle,&rdquo; was the only
reply of Mr. Ben Allen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; said Mr. Winkle; not much relishing the close connection
of the two names.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I designed &rsquo;em for each other; they were made for each other,
sent into the world for each other, born for each other, Winkle,&rdquo;
said Mr. Ben Allen, setting down his glass with emphasis.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a special destiny in the matter, my dear sir; there&rsquo;s only
five years&rsquo; difference between &rsquo;em, and both their birthdays are
in August.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Winkle was too anxious to hear what was to follow, to
express much wonderment at this extraordinary coincidence,
marvellous as it was; so Mr. Ben Allen, after a tear or two, went
on to say, that, notwithstanding all his esteem and respect and
veneration for his friend, Arabella had unaccountably and undutifully
evinced the most determined antipathy to his person.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I think,&rdquo; said Mr. Ben Allen, in conclusion, &ldquo;<em>I</em> think
there&rsquo;s a prior attachment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any idea who the object of it might be?&rdquo; asked
Mr. Winkle, with great trepidation.</p>

<p>Mr. Ben Allen seized the poker, flourished it in a warlike manner
above his head, inflicted a savage blow on an imaginary skull, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
wound up by saying, in a very expressive manner, that he only
wished he could guess; that was all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d show him what I thought of him,&rdquo; said Mr. Ben Allen.
And round went the poker again, more fiercely than before.</p>

<p>All this was, of course, very soothing to the feelings of Mr.
Winkle, who remained silent for a few minutes; but at length mustered
up resolution to inquire whether Miss Allen was in Kent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Mr. Allen, laying aside the poker, and looking
very cunning; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think Wardle&rsquo;s exactly the place for
a headstrong girl; so, as I am her natural protector and guardian,
our parents being dead, I have brought her down into this part
of the country, to spend a few months at an old aunt&rsquo;s, in a nice
dull close place. I think that will cure her, my boy. If it doesn&rsquo;t,
I&rsquo;ll take her abroad for a little while, and see what that&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the aunt&rsquo;s is in Bristol, is it?&rdquo; faltered Mr. Winkle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, not in Bristol,&rdquo; replied Mr. Ben Allen, jerking his
thumb over his right shoulder; &ldquo;over that way; down there.
But hush! here&rsquo;s Bob. Not a word, my dear friend, not a
word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Short as this conversation was, it roused in Mr. Winkle the
highest degree of excitement and anxiety. The suspected prior
attachment rankled in his heart. Could he be the object of it?
Could it be for him that the fair Arabella had looked scornfully on
the sprightly Bob Sawyer, or had he a successful rival? He
determined to see her, cost what it might; but here an insurmountable
objection presented itself, for whether the explanatory
&ldquo;over that way,&rdquo; and &ldquo;down there,&rdquo; of Mr. Ben Allen, meant
three miles off, or thirty, or three hundred, he could in no wise
guess.</p>

<p>But he had no opportunity of pondering over his love just then,
for Bob Sawyer&rsquo;s return was the immediate precursor of the arrival
of a meat pie from the baker&rsquo;s, of which that gentleman insisted on
his staying to partake. The cloth was laid by an occasional charwoman,
who officiated in the capacity of Mr. Bob Sawyer&rsquo;s
housekeeper; and a third knife and fork having been borrowed
from the mother of the boy in the grey livery (for Mr. Sawyer&rsquo;s
domestic arrangements were as yet conducted on a limited scale),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
they sat down to dinner; the beer being served up, as Mr. Sawyer
remarked, &ldquo;in its native pewter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After dinner Mr. Bob Sawyer ordered in the largest mortar in
the shop, and proceeded to brew a reeking jorum of rum-punch
therein: stirring up and amalgamating the materials with a pestle
in a very creditable and apothecary-like manner. Mr. Sawyer,
being a bachelor, had only one tumbler in the house, which was
assigned to Mr. Winkle as a compliment to the visitor: Mr. Ben
Allen being accommodated with a funnel with a cork in the narrow
end: and Bob Sawyer contented himself with one of those wide-lipped
crystal vessels inscribed with a variety of cabalistic characters,
in which chemists are wont to measure out their liquid
drugs in compounding prescriptions. These preliminaries adjusted,
the punch was tasted, and pronounced excellent; and it having
been arranged that Bob Sawyer and Ben Allen should be considered
at liberty to fill twice to Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s once, they started
fair, with great satisfaction and good-fellowship.</p>

<p>There was no singing, because Mr. Bob Sawyer said it wouldn&rsquo;t
look professional; but to make amends for this deprivation there
was so much talking and laughing that it might have been heard,
and very likely was, at the end of the street. Which conversation
materially lightened the hours and improved the mind of Mr. Bob
Sawyer&rsquo;s boy, who instead of devoting the evening to his ordinary
occupation of writing his name on the counter, and rubbing it out
again, peeped through the glass door, and thus listened and looked
on at the same time.</p>

<p>The mirth of Mr. Bob Sawyer was rapidly ripening into the
furious; Mr. Ben Allen was fast relapsing into the sentimental, and
the punch had well-nigh disappeared altogether, when the boy
hastily running in, announced that a young woman had just come
over, to say that Sawyer late Nockemorf was wanted directly, a
couple of streets off. This broke up the party. Mr. Bob Sawyer
understanding the message after some twenty repetitions, tied a
wet cloth round his head to sober himself, and, having partially
succeeded, put on his green spectacles and issued forth. Resisting
all entreaties to stay till he came back, and finding it quite impossible
to engage Mr. Ben Allen in any intelligible conversation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
on the subject nearest his heart, or indeed on any other, Mr. Winkle
took his departure, and returned to The Bush.</p>

<p>The anxiety of his mind, and the numerous meditations which
Arabella had awakened, prevented his share of the mortar of punch
producing that effect upon him which it would have had, under
other circumstances. So, after taking a glass of soda-water and
brandy at the bar, he turned into the coffee-room, dispirited rather
than elevated by the occurrences of the evening.</p>

<p>Sitting in the front of the fire, with his back towards him, was a
tallish gentleman in a great-coat: the only other occupant of the
room. It was rather a cool evening for the season of the year, and
the gentleman drew his chair aside to afford the new comer a sight
of the fire. What were Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s feelings when, in doing so,
he disclosed to view the face and figure of the vindictive and
sanguinary Dowler!</p>

<p>Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s first impulse was to give a violent pull at the
nearest bell-handle, but that unfortunately happened to be immediately
behind Mr. Dowler&rsquo;s head. He had made one step
towards it, before he checked himself. As he did so, Mr. Dowler
very hastily drew back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Winkle, sir. Be calm. Don&rsquo;t strike me. I won&rsquo;t bear
it. A blow! Never!&rdquo; said Mr. Dowler, looking meeker than Mr.
Winkle had expected in a gentleman of his ferocity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A blow, sir?&rdquo; stammered Mr. Winkle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A blow, sir,&rdquo; replied Dowler. &ldquo;Compose your feelings. Sit
down. Hear me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Winkle, trembling from head to foot, &ldquo;before I
consent to sit down beside, or opposite you, without the presence
of a waiter, I must be secured by some further understanding.
You used a threat against me last night, sir, a dreadful threat,
sir.&rdquo; Here Mr. Winkle turned very pale indeed, and stopped
short.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said Dowler, with a countenance almost as white as
Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Circumstances were suspicious. They have been
explained. I respect your bravery. Your feeling is upright.
Conscious innocence. There&rsquo;s my hand. Grasp it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Winkle, hesitating whether to give his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
hand or not, and almost fearing that it was demanded in order that
he might be taken at an advantage, &ldquo;really sir, <span class="nobreak">I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what you mean,&rdquo; interposed Dowler. &ldquo;You feel
aggrieved. Very natural. So should I. I was strong. I beg
your pardon. Be friendly. Forgive me.&rdquo; With this, Dowler
fairly forced his hand upon Mr. Winkle, and shaking it with the
utmost vehemence, declared he was a fellow of extreme spirit, and
he had a higher opinion of him than ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Dowler, &ldquo;sit down. Relate it all. How did you
find me? When did you follow? Be frank. Tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite accidental,&rdquo; replied Mr. Winkle, greatly perplexed
by the curious and unexpected nature of the interview, &ldquo;quite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glad of it,&rdquo; said Dowler. &ldquo;I woke this morning. I had
forgotten my threat. I laughed at the accident. I felt friendly.
I said so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To whom?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Winkle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Mrs. Dowler. &lsquo;You made a vow,&rsquo; said she. &lsquo;I did,&rsquo; said
I. &lsquo;It was a rash one,&rsquo; said she. &lsquo;It was,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll apologise.
Where is he?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Winkle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You,&rdquo; replied Dowler. &ldquo;I went down-stairs. You were not
to be found. Pickwick looked gloomy. Shook his head. Hoped
no violence would be committed. I saw it all. You felt yourself
insulted. You had gone, for a friend perhaps. Possibly for pistols.
&lsquo;High spirit,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;I admire him.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Winkle coughed, and beginning to see how the land lay,
assumed a look of importance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I left a note for you,&rdquo; resumed Dowler. &ldquo;I said I was sorry.
So I was. Pressing business called me here. You were not satisfied.
You followed. You required a verbal explanation. You were
right. It&rsquo;s all over now. My business is finished. I go back
to-morrow. Join me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Dowler progressed in his explanation, Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s countenance
grew more and more dignified. The mysterious nature of the
commencement of their conversation was explained; Mr. Dowler
had as great an objection to duelling as himself; in short, this
blustering and awful personage was one of the most egregious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
cowards in existence, and interpreting Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s absence
through the medium of his own fears, had taken the same step as
himself, and prudently retired until all excitement of feeling should
have subsided.</p>

<p>As the real state of the case dawned upon Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s mind,
he looked very terrible, and said he was perfectly satisfied; but, at
the same time, said so with an air that left Mr. Dowler no alternative
but to infer that if he had not been, something most horrible
and destructive must inevitably have occurred. Mr. Dowler
appeared to be impressed with a becoming sense of Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s
magnanimity and condescension; and the two belligerents parted
for the night, with many protestations of eternal friendship.</p>

<p>About half-past twelve o&rsquo;clock, when Mr. Winkle had been
revelling some twenty minutes in the full luxury of his first sleep,
he was suddenly awakened by a loud knocking at his chamber
door, which being repeated with increased vehemence, caused him
to start up in bed, and inquire who was there, and what the
matter was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, sir, here&rsquo;s a young man which says he must see you
directly,&rdquo; responded the voice of the chambermaid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A young man!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Winkle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No mistake about that &rsquo;ere, sir,&rdquo; replied another voice through
the keyhole; &ldquo;and if that wery same interestin&rsquo; young creetur ain&rsquo;t
let in vithout delay, it&rsquo;s wery possible as his legs vill enter afore his
countenance.&rdquo; The young man gave a gentle kick at one of the
lower panels of the door, after he had given utterance to this hint,
as if to add force and point to the remark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Sam?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Winkle, springing out
of bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite unpossible to identify any gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n vith any degree o&rsquo;
mental satisfaction, vithout lookin&rsquo; at him, sir,&rdquo; replied the voice,
dogmatically.</p>

<p>Mr. Winkle, not much doubting who the young man was, unlocked
the door; which he had no sooner done, than Mr. Samuel
Weller entered with great precipitation, and carefully re-locking it
on the inside, deliberately put the key in his waistcoat pocket: and,
after surveying Mr. Winkle from head to foot, said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a wery humorous young gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n, you air, sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by this conduct, Sam?&rdquo; inquired Mr.
Winkle, indignantly. &ldquo;Get out, sir, this instant. What do you
mean, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do <em>I</em> mean,&rdquo; retorted Sam; &ldquo;come, sir, this is rayther
too rich, as the young lady said, ven she remonstrated with the
pastry-cook, arter he&rsquo;d sold her a pork-pie as had got nothin&rsquo;
but fat inside. What do <em>I</em> mean! Well, that ain&rsquo;t a bad un,
that ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unlock that door, and leave this room immediately, sir,&rdquo; said
Mr. Winkle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall leave this here room, sir, just precisely at the wery
same moment as you leaves it,&rdquo; responded Sam, speaking in a
forcible manner, and seating himself with perfect gravity. &ldquo;If I
find it necessary to carry you away, pick-a-back, o&rsquo; course I shall
leave it the least bit o&rsquo; time possible afore you; but allow me to
express a hope as you won&rsquo;t reduce me to extremities; in saying
vich, I merely quote wot the nobleman said to the fractious pennywinkle,
ven he vouldn&rsquo;t come out of his shell by means of a pin,
and he conseqvently began to be afeared that he should be obliged
to crack him in the parlour door.&rdquo; At the end of this address,
which was unusually lengthy for him, Mr. Weller planted his hands
on his knees, and looked full in Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s face, with an expression
of countenance that showed that he had not the remotest intention
of being trifled with.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a amiably disposed young man, sir, I don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo;
resumed Mr. Weller, in a tone of moral reproof, &ldquo;to go inwolving
our precious governor in all sorts o&rsquo; fanteegs, ven he&rsquo;s made up his
mind to go through everythink for principle. You&rsquo;re far worse nor
Dodson, sir; and as for Fogg, I consider him a born angel to you!&rdquo;
Mr. Weller having accompanied this last sentiment with an emphatic
slap on each knee, folded his arms with a look of great
disgust, and threw himself back in his chair, as if awaiting the
criminal&rsquo;s defence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My good fellow,&rdquo; said Mr. Winkle, extending his hand; his
teeth chattering all the time he spoke, for he had been standing,
during the whole of Mr. Weller&rsquo;s lecture, in his night-gear; &ldquo;my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
good fellow, I respect your attachment to my excellent friend, and
I am very sorry indeed, to have added to his causes for disquiet.
There, Sam, there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sam, rather sulkily, but giving the proffered hand
a respectful shake at the same time: &ldquo;well, so you ought to be,
and I am very glad to find you air; for, if I can help it, I won&rsquo;t
have him put upon by nobody, and that&rsquo;s all about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not, Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Winkle. &ldquo;There! Now go
to bed, Sam, and we&rsquo;ll talk further about this in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wery sorry,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t go to bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not go to bed!&rdquo; repeated Mr. Winkle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Sam, shaking his head. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you&rsquo;re going back to-night, Sam?&rdquo;
urged Mr. Winkle, greatly surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not unless you particklerly wish it,&rdquo; replied Sam; &ldquo;but
mustn&rsquo;t leave this here room. The governor&rsquo;s orders was
peremptory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Winkle, &ldquo;I must stop here two or
three days; and more than that, Sam, you must stop here too, to
assist me in gaining an interview with a young lady&mdash;Miss Allen,
Sam; you remember her&mdash;whom I must and will see before I leave
Bristol.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But in reply to each of these positions, Sam shook his head
with great firmness, and energetically replied, &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a great deal of argument and representation on the part
of Mr. Winkle, however, and a full disclosure of what had passed
in the interview with Dowler, Sam began to waver; and at length
a compromise was effected, of which the following were the main
and principal conditions:</p>

<p>That Sam should retire, and leave Mr. Winkle in the undisturbed
possession of his apartment, on the condition that he had permission
to lock the door on the outside, and carry off the key; provided
always, that in the event of an alarm of fire, or other dangerous
contingency, the door should be instantly unlocked. That a letter
should be written to Mr. Pickwick early next morning, and forwarded
per Dowler, requesting his consent to Sam and Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s
remaining at Bristol, for the purpose, and with the object, already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
assigned, and begging an answer by the next coach; if favourable,
the aforesaid parties to remain accordingly, and if not, to return
to Bath immediately on the receipt thereof. And, lastly, that
Mr. Winkle should be understood as distinctly pledging himself
not to resort to the window, fireplace, or other surreptitious mode
of escape in the meanwhile. These stipulations having been concluded,
Sam locked the door and departed.</p>

<p>He had nearly got down-stairs, when he stopped, and drew the
key from his pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I quite forgot about the knockin&rsquo; down,&rdquo; said Sam, half turning
back. &ldquo;The governor distinctly said it was to be done. Amazin&rsquo;
stupid o&rsquo; me, that &rsquo;ere! Never mind,&rdquo; said Sam, brightening up,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s easily done to-morrow, anyvays.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Apparently much consoled by this reflection, Mr. Weller once
more deposited the key in his pocket, and descending the remainder
of the stairs without any fresh visitations of conscience,
was soon, in common with the other inmates of the house, buried
in profound repose.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">During</span> the whole of the next day, Sam kept Mr.
Winkle steadily in sight, fully determined not
to take his eyes off him for one instant, until he
should receive express instructions from the
fountain-head. However disagreeable Sam&rsquo;s
very close watch and great vigilance were to
Mr. Winkle, he thought it better to bear with them, than, by
any act of violent opposition, to hazard being carried away by
force, which Mr. Weller more than once strongly hinted was
the line of conduct that a strict sense of duty prompted him
to pursue. There is little reason to doubt that Sam would very
speedily have quieted his scruples by bearing Mr. Winkle back
to Bath, bound hand and foot, had not Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s prompt
attention to the note, which Dowler had undertaken to deliver,
forestalled any such proceeding. In short, at eight o&rsquo;clock in the
evening, Mr. Pickwick himself walked into the coffee-room of the
Bush tavern, and told Sam with a smile, to his very great relief,
that he had done quite right, and it was unnecessary for him to
mount guard any longer.</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;I thought it better to come myself,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick,
addressing Mr. Winkle, as Sam disencumbered him of his great-coat
and travelling shawl, &ldquo;to ascertain, before I gave my consent
to Sam&rsquo;s employment in this matter, that you are quite in earnest
and serious, with respect to this young lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Serious from my heart&mdash;from my soul!&rdquo; returned Mr.
Winkle, with great energy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with beaming eyes, &ldquo;we met
her at our excellent and hospitable friend&rsquo;s, Winkle. It would be
an ill return to tamper lightly, and without due consideration,
with this young lady&rsquo;s affections. I&rsquo;ll not allow this, sir. I&rsquo;ll not
allow it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no such intention, indeed,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Winkle,
warmly. &ldquo;I have considered the matter well, for a long time, and
I feel that my happiness is bound up in her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s wot we call tying it up in a small parcel, sir,&rdquo; interposed
Mr. Weller, with an agreeable smile.</p>

<p>Mr. Winkle looked somewhat stern at this interruption, and Mr.
Pickwick angrily requested his attendant not to jest with one of
the best feelings of our nature; to which Sam replied, &ldquo;That he
wouldn&rsquo;t, if he was aware on it; but there were so many on &rsquo;em,
that he hardly know&rsquo;d which was the best ones ven he heer&rsquo;d &rsquo;em
mentioned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Winkle then recounted what had passed between himself
and Mr. Ben Allen, relative to Arabella; stated that his object
was to gain an interview with the young lady, and make a formal
disclosure of his passion; and declared his conviction, founded on
certain dark hints and mutterings of the aforesaid Ben, that,
wherever she was at present immured, it was somewhere near the
Downs. And this was his whole stock of knowledge or suspicion
on the subject.</p>

<p>With this very slight clue to guide him, it was determined that
Mr. Weller should start next morning on an expedition of discovery;
it was also arranged that Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Winkle, who were
less confident of their powers, should parade the town meanwhile,
and accidentally drop in upon Mr. Bob Sawyer in the course of the
day, in the hope of seeing or hearing something of the young
lady&rsquo;s whereabout.</p>

<p>Accordingly, next morning, Sam Weller issued forth upon his
quest, in no way daunted by the very discouraging prospect before
him; and away he walked, up one street and down another&mdash;we
were going to say, up one hill and down another, only it&rsquo;s all uphill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
at Clifton&mdash;without meeting with anything or anybody that tended
to throw the faintest light on the matter in hand. Many were the
colloquies into which Sam entered with grooms who were airing
horses on roads, and nursemaids who were airing children in lanes;
but nothing could Sam elicit from either the first-mentioned or the
last, which bore the slightest reference to the object of his artfully-prosecuted
inquiries. There were a great many young ladies in a
great many houses, the greater part whereof were ere shrewdly suspected
by the male and female domestics to be deeply attached to
somebody, or perfectly ready to become so, if opportunity offered.
But as none among these young ladies was Miss Arabella Allen,
the information left Sam at exactly the old point of wisdom at
which he had stood before.</p>

<p>Sam struggled across the Downs against a good high wind,
wondering whether it was always necessary to hold your hat on
with both hands in that part of the country, and came to a shady
by-place about which were sprinkled several little villas of quiet
and secluded appearance. Outside a stable-door at the bottom of
a long back lane without a thoroughfare, a groom in undress was
idling about, apparently persuading himself that he was doing
something with a spade and a wheelbarrow. We may remark, in
this place, that we have scarcely ever seen a groom near a stable,
in his lazy moments, who has not been, to a greater or less extent,
the victim of this singular delusion.</p>

<p>Sam thought he might as well talk to this groom as to any one
else, especially as he was very tired with walking, and there was a
good large stone just opposite the wheelbarrow; so he strolled down
the lane, and, seating himself on the stone, opened a conversation
with the ease and freedom for which he was remarkable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mornin&rsquo;, old friend,&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arternoon, you mean,&rdquo; replied the groom, casting a surly look
at Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wery right, old friend,&rdquo; said Sam; &ldquo;I <em>do</em> mean arternoon.
How are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t find myself much the better for seeing you,&rdquo;
replied the ill-tempered groom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s wery odd&mdash;that is,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;for you look so uncommon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
cheerful, and seem altogether so lively, that it does vun&rsquo;s
heart good to see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The surly groom looked surlier still at this, but not sufficiently
so to produce any effect upon Sam, who immediately inquired, with
a countenance of great anxiety, whether his master&rsquo;s name was
not Walker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the groom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor Brown, I s&rsquo;pose?&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor Vilson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; nor that neither,&rdquo; said the groom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vell,&rdquo; replied Sam, &ldquo;then I&rsquo;m mistaken, and he hasn&rsquo;t got the
honour o&rsquo; my acquaintance, which I thought he had. Don&rsquo;t wait
here out o&rsquo; compliment to me,&rdquo; said Sam, as the groom wheeled in
the barrow, and prepared to shut the gate. &ldquo;Ease afore ceremony,
old boy; I&rsquo;ll excuse you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d knock your head off for half-a-crown,&rdquo; said the surly
groom, bolting one half of the gate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t afford to have it done on those terms,&rdquo; rejoined Sam.
&ldquo;It &rsquo;ud be worth a life&rsquo;s board vages at least, to you, and &rsquo;ud be
cheap at that. Make my compliments indoors. Tell &rsquo;em not to
vait dinner for me, and say they needn&rsquo;t mind puttin&rsquo; any by, for
it&rsquo;ll be cold afore I come in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In reply to this the groom, waxing very wroth, muttered a desire
to damage somebody&rsquo;s person; but disappeared without carrying
it into execution, slamming the door angrily after him, and wholly
unheeding Sam&rsquo;s affectionate request that he would leave him a
lock of his hair before he went.</p>

<p>Sam continued to sit on the large stone, meditating upon what
was best to be done, and revolving in his mind a plan for knocking
at all the doors within five miles of Bristol, taking them at a
hundred and fifty or two hundred a day, and endeavouring to find
Miss Arabella by that expedient, when accident all of a sudden
threw in his way what he might have sat there for a twelvemonth
and yet not found without it.</p>

<p>Into the lane where he sat, there opened three or four garden-gates,
belonging to as many houses, which though detached from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
each other, were only separated by their gardens. As these were
large and long, and well planted with trees, the houses were not
only at some distance off, but the greater part of them were nearly
concealed from view. Sam was sitting with his eyes fixed upon
the dust-heap outside the next gate to that by which the groom
had disappeared, profoundly turning over in his mind the difficulties
of his present undertaking, when the gate opened, and
a female servant came out into the lane to shake some bed-side
carpets.</p>

<p>Sam was so very busy with his own thoughts, that it is probable
he would have taken no more notice of the young woman than
just raising his head and remarking that she had a very neat and
pretty figure, if his feelings of gallantry had not been most strongly
roused by observing that she had no one to help her, and that the
carpets seemed too heavy for her single strength. Mr. Weller was
a gentleman of great gallantry in his own way, and he no sooner
remarked this circumstance then he hastily rose from the large
stone, and advanced towards her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Sam, sliding up with an air of great respect,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll spile that wery pretty figure out o&rsquo; all perportion if you
shake them carpets by yourself. Let me help you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young lady, who had been coyly affecting not to know that
a gentleman was so near, turned round as Sam spoke&mdash;no doubt
(indeed she said so afterwards) to decline this offer from a perfect
stranger&mdash;when instead of speaking, she started back, and uttered
a half-suppressed scream. Sam was scarcely less staggered, for in
the countenance of the well-shaped female servant, he beheld
the very features of his Valentine, the pretty housemaid from
Mr. Nupkins&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vy, Mary, my dear!&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lauk, Mr. Weller,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;how you do frighten one!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam made no verbal answer to this complaint, nor can we precisely
say what reply he <em>did</em> make. We merely know that after a
short pause Mary said, &ldquo;Lor, do adun, Mr. Weller!&rdquo; and that his
hat had fallen off a few moments before&mdash;from both of which tokens
we should be disposed to infer that one kiss or more had passed
between the parties.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 631px;"><a id="color06"></a>
<img src="images/color06.jpg" width="631" height="459" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>&ldquo;Lor&rsquo;, do adun, Mr. Weller!&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, how did you come here?&rdquo; said Mary, when the conversation
to which this interruption had been offered was resumed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O&rsquo; course I came to look arter you, my darlin&rsquo;,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Weller; for once permitting his passion to get the better of his
veracity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how did you know I was here?&rdquo; inquired Mary. &ldquo;Who
could have told you that I took another service at Ipswich, and
that they afterwards moved all the way here? Who <em>could</em> have
told you that, Mr. Weller?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah to be sure,&rdquo; said Sam, with a cunning look, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the
pint. Who could ha&rsquo; told me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t Mr. Muzzle, was it?&rdquo; inquired Mary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; replied Sam, with a solemn shake of the head, &ldquo;it
warn&rsquo;t him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must have been the cook,&rdquo; said Mary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O&rsquo; course it must,&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I never heard the like of that!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more did I,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;But Mary, my dear:&rdquo; here
Sam&rsquo;s manner grew extremely affectionate: &ldquo;Mary, my dear, I&rsquo;ve
got another affair in hand as is wery pressin&rsquo;. There&rsquo;s one o&rsquo; my
governor&rsquo;s friends&mdash;Mr. Winkle, you remember him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Him in the green coat?&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;Oh yes, I remember
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s in a horrid state o&rsquo; love; reg&rsquo;larly
comfoozled, and done over with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lor!&rdquo; interposed Mary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sam: &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s nothing if we could find out the
young &rsquo;ooman;&rdquo; and here Sam, with many digressions upon the
personal beauty of Mary, and the unspeakable tortures he had
experienced since he last saw her, gave a faithful account of Mr.
Winkle&rsquo;s present predicament.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;I never did!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O&rsquo; course not,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;nobody never did, nor never
vill neither; and here am I a walkin&rsquo; about like the Wandering Jew&mdash;a
sportin&rsquo; character you have perhaps heerd on, Mary, my dear,
as wos alvays doin&rsquo; a match agin&rsquo; time, and never vent to sleep&mdash;looking
arter this here Miss Arabella Allen.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss who?&rdquo; said Mary, in great astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Arabella Allen,&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness gracious!&rdquo; said Mary, pointing the garden door
which the sulky groom had locked after him. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s that
very house; she&rsquo;s been living there these six weeks. Their upper
housemaid, which is lady&rsquo;s maid too, told me all about it over the
wash-house palin&rsquo;s before the family was out of bed one mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot, the wery next door to you?&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The very next,&rdquo; replied Mary.</p>

<p>Mr. Weller was so deeply overcome on receiving this intelligence
that he found it absolutely necessary to cling to his fair informant
for support; and divers little love passages had passed between
them, before he was sufficiently collected to return to the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vell,&rdquo; said Sam at length, &ldquo;if this don&rsquo;t beat cock-fightin&rsquo;,
nothin&rsquo; never vill, as the Lord Mayor said, ven the chief secretary
o&rsquo; state proposed his missis&rsquo;s health arter dinner. That wery next
house! Wy, I&rsquo;ve got a message to her as I&rsquo;ve been a tryin&rsquo; all day
to deliver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;but you can&rsquo;t deliver it now, because she
only walks in the garden in the evening, and then only for a very
little time; she never goes out, without the old lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam ruminated for a few moments, and finally hit upon the
following plan of operations; that he should return just at dusk&mdash;the
time at which Arabella invariably took her walk&mdash;and, being
admitted by Mary into the garden of the house to which she
belonged, would contrive to scramble up the wall, beneath the overhanging
boughs of a large pear-tree, which would effectually screen
him from observation; would there deliver his message, and
arrange, if possible, an interview on behalf of Mr. Winkle for the
ensuing evening at the same hour. Having made this arrangement
with great despatch, he assisted Mary in the long-deferred occupation
of shaking the carpets.</p>

<p>It is not half as innocent a thing as it looks, that shaking little
pieces of carpet&mdash;at least, there may be no great harm in the
shaking, but the folding is a very insidious process. So long as the
shaking lasts, and the two parties are kept the carpet&rsquo;s length
apart, it is as innocent an amusement as can well be devised; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
when the folding begins, and the distance between them get
gradually lessened from one half its former length to a quarter,
and then to an eighth, and then to a sixteenth, and then to a thirty-second,
if the carpet be long enough: it becomes dangerous. We
do not know, to a nicety, how many pieces of carpet were folded
in this instance, but we can venture to state that as many pieces
as there were, so many times did Sam kiss the pretty housemaid.</p>

<p>Mr. Weller regaled himself with moderation at the nearest tavern
until it was nearly dusk, and then returned to the lane without the
thoroughfare. Having been admitted into the garden by Mary,
and having received from that lady sundry admonitions concerning
the safety of his limbs and neck, Sam mounted into the pear-tree,
to wait until Arabella should come in sight.</p>

<p>He waited so long without this anxiously expected event
occurring, that he began to think it was not going to take place at
all, when he heard light footsteps upon the gravel, and immediately
afterwards beheld Arabella walking pensively down the garden.
As soon as she came nearly below the tree, Sam began, by way of
gently indicating his presence, to make sundry diabolical noises similar
to those which would probably be natural to a person of middle
age who had been afflicted with a combination of inflammatory sore
throat, croup, and hooping-cough, from his earliest infancy.</p>

<p>Upon this, the young lady cast a hurried glance towards the spot
from whence the dreadful sounds proceeded; and her previous
alarm being not at all diminished when she saw a man among the
branches, she would most certainly have decamped, and alarmed
the house, had not fear fortunately deprived her of the power of
moving, and caused her to sink down on a garden-seat; which
happened by good luck to be near at hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a goin&rsquo; off,&rdquo; soliloquised Sam in great perplexity. &ldquo;Wot
a thing it is, as these here young creeturs <em>will</em> go a faintin&rsquo; avay
just ven they oughtn&rsquo;t to. Here, young &rsquo;ooman, Miss Sawbones,
Mrs. Vinkle, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whether it was the magic of Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s name, or the coolness
of the open air, or some recollection of Mr. Weller&rsquo;s voice, that
revived Arabella, matters not. She raised her head and languidly
inquired, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that, and what do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Sam, swinging himself on to the wall, and crouching
there in as small a compass as he could reduce himself to; &ldquo;only
me, miss, only me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s servant?&rdquo; said Arabella, earnestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wery same, miss,&rdquo; replied Sam. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Mr. Vinkle
reg&rsquo;larly sewed up vith desperation, miss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Arabella, drawing nearer the wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, indeed,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;Ve thought ve should ha&rsquo; been
obliged to straight-veskit him last night; he&rsquo;s been a ravin&rsquo; all
day; and he says if he can&rsquo;t see you afore to-morrow night&rsquo;s over,
he vishes he may be somethin&rsquo;-unpleasanted if he don&rsquo;t drownd
hisself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, no, Mr. Weller!&rdquo; said Arabella, clasping her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s wot he says, miss,&rdquo; replied Sam. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a man of his
word, and it&rsquo;s my opinion he&rsquo;ll do it, miss. He&rsquo;s heerd all about
you from the Sawbones in barnacles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From my brother!&rdquo; said Arabella, having some faint recognition
of Sam&rsquo;s description.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t rightly know which is your brother, miss,&rdquo; replied Sam.
&ldquo;Is it the dirtiest vun o&rsquo; the two?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, Mr. Weller,&rdquo; returned Arabella, &ldquo;go on. Make
haste, pray.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well miss,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s heerd all about it from him; and
it&rsquo;s the gov&rsquo;nor&rsquo;s opinion that if you don&rsquo;t see him wery quick, the
Sawbones as we&rsquo;ve been a speaking on, &rsquo;ull get as much extra lead
in his head as&rsquo;ll damage the dewelopment o&rsquo; the orgins if they ever
put it in spirits artervards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what can I do to prevent these dreadful quarrels!&rdquo; exclaimed
Arabella.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the suspicion of a priory &rsquo;tachment as is the cause of it all,&rdquo;
replied Sam. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better see him, miss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how?&mdash;where?&rdquo; cried Arabella. &ldquo;I dare not leave the
house alone. My brother is so unkind, so unreasonable! I know
how strange my talking thus to you must appear, Mr. Weller, but
I am very, very unhappy&mdash;&rdquo; and here poor Arabella wept so
bitterly, that Sam grew chivalrous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may seem wery strange talkin&rsquo; to me about these here affairs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
miss,&rdquo; said Sam with great vehemence: &ldquo;but all I can say is, that
I&rsquo;m not only ready but villin&rsquo; to do anythin&rsquo; as&rsquo;ll make matters
agreeable; and if chuckin&rsquo; either o&rsquo; them Sawboneses out o&rsquo; winder
&rsquo;ull do it, I&rsquo;m the man.&rdquo; As Sam Weller said his, he tucked up
his wristbands, at the imminent hazard of falling off the wall in so
doing, to intimate his readiness to set to work immediately.</p>

<p>Flattering as these professions of good feeling were, Arabella
resolutely declined (most unaccountably, as Sam thought) to avail
herself of them. For some time she strenuously refused to grant
Mr. Winkle the interview Sam had so pathetically requested; but
at length, when the conversation threatened to be interrupted by
the unwelcome arrival of a third party, she hurriedly gave him to
understand, with many professions of gratitude, that it was barely
possible she might be in the garden an hour later, next evening.
Sam understood this perfectly well; and Arabella, bestowing upon
him one of her sweetest smiles, tripped gracefully away, leaving
Mr. Weller in a state of very great admiration of her charms, both
personal and mental.</p>

<p>Having descended in safety from the wall, and not forgotten to
devote a few moments to his own particular business in the same
department, Mr. Weller then made the best of his way back to the
Bush, where his prolonged absence had occasioned much speculation
and some alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must be careful,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, after listening attentively
to Sam&rsquo;s tale, &ldquo;not for our own sakes, but for that of the
young lady. We must be very cautious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>We!</em>&rdquo; said Mr. Winkle, with marked emphasis.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s momentary look of indignation at the tone of
this remark subsided into his characteristic expression of benevolence,
as he replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>We</em>, sir! I shall accompany you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; said Mr. Winkle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, mildly. &ldquo;In affording you this interview,
the young lady has taken a natural, perhaps, but still a very
imprudent step. If I am present at the meeting, a mutual friend,
who is old enough to be the father of both parties, the voice of
calumny can never be raised against her hereafter.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s eyes lightened with honest exultation at his own
foresight, as he spoke thus. Mr. Winkle was touched by this little
trait of his delicate respect for the young <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégée</i> of his friend, and
took his hand with a feeling of regard, akin to veneration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You <em>shall</em> go,&rdquo; said Mr. Winkle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;Sam, have my great-coat and
shawl ready, and order a conveyance to be at the door to-morrow
evening, rather earlier than is absolutely necessary, in order that
we may be in good time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Weller touched his hat, as an earnest of his obedience, and
withdrew to make all needful preparations for the expedition.</p>

<p>The coach was punctual to the time appointed; and Mr. Weller,
after duly installing Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Winkle inside, took his
seat on the box by the driver. They alighted, as had been agreed
on, about a quarter of a mile from the place of rendezvous, and
desiring the coachman to await their return, proceeded the remaining
distance on foot.</p>

<p>It was at this stage of the undertaking that Mr. Pickwick, with
many smiles and various other indications of great self-satisfaction,
produced from one of his coat pockets a dark lantern, with which
he had specially provided himself for the occasion, and the great
mechanical beauty of which he proceeded to explain to Mr. Winkle
as they walked along, to the no small surprise of the few stragglers
they met.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have been the better for something of this kind in
my last garden expedition, at night; eh, Sam?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick,
looking good-humouredly round at his follower, who was trudging
behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wery nice things if they&rsquo;re managed properly, sir,&rdquo; replied
Mr. Weller; &ldquo;but when you don&rsquo;t want to be seen, I think they&rsquo;re
more useful arter the candle&rsquo;s gone out, than ven it&rsquo;s alight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick appeared struck with Sam&rsquo;s remarks, for he put the
lantern into his pocket again, and they walked on in silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down here, sir,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;Let me lead the way. This is
the lane, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Down the lane they went, and dark enough it was. Mr. Pickwick
brought out the lantern, once or twice, as they groped their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
way along, and threw a very brilliant little tunnel of light before
them, about a foot in diameter. It was very pretty to look at, but
seemed to have the effect of rendering surrounding objects rather
darker than before.</p>

<p>At length they arrived at the large stone. Here Sam recommended
his master and Mr. Winkle to seat themselves, while
he reconnoitred, and ascertained whether Mary was yet in
waiting.</p>

<p>After an absence of five or ten minutes, Sam returned, to say
that the gate was opened, and all quiet. Following him with
stealthy tread, Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Winkle soon found themselves
in the garden. Here everybody said &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; a good many
times; and that being done, no one seemed to have any very
distinct apprehension of what was to be done next.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Miss Allen in the garden yet, Mary?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Winkle,
much agitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rdquo; replied the pretty housemaid. &ldquo;The best
thing to be done, sir, will be for Mr. Weller to give you a hoist up
into the tree, and perhaps Mr. Pickwick will have the goodness to
see that nobody comes up the lane, while I watch at the other end
of the garden. Goodness gracious, what&rsquo;s that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That &rsquo;ere blessed lantern &rsquo;ull be the death on us all,&rdquo; exclaimed
Sam, peevishly. &ldquo;Take care wot you&rsquo;re a doin&rsquo; on, sir; you&rsquo;re a
sendin&rsquo; a blaze o&rsquo; light, right into the back parlour winder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, turning hastily aside, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
mean to do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, it&rsquo;s in the next house, sir,&rdquo; remonstrated Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless my heart!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, turning round
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, it&rsquo;s in the stable, and they&rsquo;ll think the place is afire,&rdquo;
said Sam. &ldquo;Shut it up, sir, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the most extraordinary lantern I ever met with, in all
my life!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, greatly bewildered by the effects
he had so unintentionally produced. &ldquo;I never saw such a powerful
reflector.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be vun too powerful for us, if you keep blazin&rsquo; avay in that
manner, sir,&rdquo; replied Sam, as Mr. Pickwick, after various unsuccessful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
efforts, managed to close the slide. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the young lady&rsquo;s
footsteps. Now, Mr. Vinkle, sir, up vith you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop, stop!&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;I must speak to her first.
Help me up, Sam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gently, sir,&rdquo; said Sam, planting his head against the wall, and
making a platform of his back. &ldquo;Step a top o&rsquo; that &rsquo;ere flower-pot,
sir. Now then, up vith you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I shall hurt you, Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind me, sir,&rdquo; replied Sam. &ldquo;Lend him a hand, Mr.
Vinkle, sir. Steady, sir, steady. That&rsquo;s the time o&rsquo; day!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Sam spoke, Mr. Pickwick, by exertions almost supernatural
in a gentleman of his years and weight, contrived to get upon
Sam&rsquo;s back; and Sam gently raising himself up, and Mr. Pickwick
holding on fast by the top of the wall, while Mr. Winkle clasped
him tight by the legs, they contrived by these means to bring his
spectacles just above the level of the coping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, looking over the wall, and
catching sight of Arabella, on the other side. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened,
my dear, it&rsquo;s only me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh pray go away, Mr. Pickwick,&rdquo; said Arabella. &ldquo;Tell them
all to go away. I am so dreadfully frightened. Dear, dear Mr.
Pickwick, don&rsquo;t stop there. You&rsquo;ll fall down and kill yourself, I
know you will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, pray don&rsquo;t alarm yourself, my dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick
soothingly. &ldquo;There is not the least cause for fear, I assure you.
Stand firm, Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, looking down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be longer than
you can conweniently help, sir. You&rsquo;re rayther heavy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only another moment, Sam,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;I
merely wished you to know, my dear, that I should not have allowed
my young friend to see you in this clandestine way, if the situation
in which you are placed had left him any alternative; and lest the
impropriety of this step should cause you any uneasiness, my love,
it may be a satisfaction to you, to know that I am present. That&rsquo;s
all, my dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Mr. Pickwick, I am very much obliged to you for your
kindness and consideration,&rdquo; replied Arabella, drying her tears with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
her handkerchief. She would probably have said much more, had
not Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s head disappeared with great swiftness, in consequence
of a false step on Sam&rsquo;s shoulder, which brought him
suddenly to the ground. He was up again in an instant, however,
and bidding Mr. Winkle make haste and get the interview over,
ran out into the lane to keep watch, with all the courage and ardour
of youth. Mr. Winkle himself, inspired by the occasion, was on
the wall in a moment, merely pausing to request Sam to be careful
of his master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care on him, sir,&rdquo; replied Sam. &ldquo;Leave him to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is he? What&rsquo;s he doing, Sam?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Winkle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless his old gaiters!&rdquo; rejoined Sam, looking out at the garden
door, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a keepin&rsquo; guard in the lane vith that &rsquo;ere dark lantern,
like a amiable Guy Fawkes! I never see such a fine creetur in my
days. Blessed if I don&rsquo;t think his heart must ha&rsquo; been born five-and-twenty
year arter his body, at least!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Winkle stayed not to hear the encomium upon his friend.
He had dropped from the wall; thrown himself at Arabella&rsquo;s feet;
and by this time was pleading the sincerity of his passion with an
eloquence worthy even of Mr. Pickwick himself.</p>

<p>While these things were going on in the open air, an elderly
gentleman of scientific attainments was seated in his library, two
or three houses off, writing a philosophical treatise, and ever and
anon moistening his clay and his labours with a glass of claret from
a venerable-looking bottle which stood by his side. In the agonies
of composition, the elderly gentleman looked sometimes at the
carpet, sometimes at the ceiling, and sometimes at the wall; and
when neither carpet, ceiling, nor wall, afforded the requisite degree
of inspiration, he looked out of the window.</p>

<p>In one of these pauses of invention, the scientific gentleman was
gazing abstractedly on the thick darkness outside, when he was
very much surprised by observing a most brilliant light glide through
the air at a short distance above the ground, and almost instantaneously
vanish. After a short time the phenomenon was repeated,
not once or twice, but several times: at last the scientific gentleman,
laying down his pen, began to consider to what natural causes
these appearances were to be assigned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>They were not meteors; they were too low. They were not
glow-worms; they were too high. They were not will-o&rsquo;-the-wisps;
they were not fire-flies; they were not fire-works. What
could they be? Some extraordinary and wonderful phenomenon of
nature, which no philosopher had ever seen before; something
which it had been reserved for him alone to discover, and which he
should immortalise his name by chronicling for the benefit of
posterity. Full of this idea, the scientific gentleman seized his pen
again, and committed to paper sundry notes of these unparalleled
appearances, with the date, day, hour, minute, and precise second
at which they were visible: all of which were to form the data of
a voluminous treatise of great research and deep learning, which
should astonish all the atmospherical sages that ever drew breath
in any part of the civilised globe.</p>

<p>He threw himself back in his easy chair, wrapped in contemplations
of his future greatness. The mysterious light appeared more
brilliantly than before: dancing, to all appearances, up and down
the lane, crossing from side to side, and moving in an orbit as
eccentric as comets themselves.</p>

<p>The scientific gentleman was a bachelor. He had no wife to call
in and astonish, so he rang the bell for his servant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pruffle,&rdquo; said the scientific gentleman, &ldquo;there is something
very extraordinary in the air to-night. Did you see that?&rdquo; said
the scientific gentleman, pointing out of the window, as the light
again became visible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think of it, Pruffle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think of it, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. You have been bred up in this country. What should
you say was the cause of those lights, now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The scientific gentleman smilingly anticipated Pruffle&rsquo;s reply
that he could assign no cause for them at all. Pruffle meditated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say it was thieves, sir,&rdquo; said Pruffle at length.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fool, and may go down-stairs,&rdquo; said the scientific
gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Pruffle. And down he went.</p>

<p>But the scientific gentleman could not rest under the idea of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
ingenious treatise he had projected being lost to the world, which
must inevitably be the case if the speculation of the ingenious Mr.
Pruffle were not stifled in its birth. He put on his hat and walked
quickly down the garden, determined to investigate the matter to
the very bottom.</p>

<p>Now, shortly before the scientific gentleman walked out into the
garden, Mr. Pickwick had run down the lane as fast as he could, to
convey a false alarm that somebody was coming that way; occasionally
drawing back the slide of the dark lantern to keep himself
from the ditch. The alarm was no sooner given, than Mr. Winkle
scrambled back over the wall, and Arabella ran into the house; the
garden-gate was shut, and the three adventurers were making
the best of their way down the lane, when they were startled by the
scientific old gentleman unlocking his garden-gate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold hard,&rdquo; whispered Sam, who was, of course, the first of the
party. &ldquo;Show a light for just vun second, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick did as he was desired, and Sam, seeing a man&rsquo;s
head peeping out very cautiously within half a yard of his own,
gave it a gentle tap with his clenched fist, which knocked it, with a
hollow sound, against the gate. Having performed this feat with
great suddenness and dexterity, Mr. Weller caught Mr. Pickwick
up on his back, and followed Mr. Winkle down the lane at a pace
which, considering the burden he carried, was perfectly astonishing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you got your vind back agin, sir,&rdquo; inquired Sam, when
they had reached the end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite. Quite, now,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then come along, sir,&rdquo; said Sam, setting his master on his feet
again. &ldquo;Come between us, sir. Not half a mile to run. Think
you&rsquo;re vinnin&rsquo; a cup, sir. Now for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, Mr. Pickwick made the very best use of his
legs. It may be confidently stated that a pair of black gaiters never
got over the ground in better style than did those of Mr. Pickwick
on this memorable occasion.</p>

<p>The coach was waiting, the horses were fresh, the roads were
good, and the driver was willing. The whole party arrived in
safety at the Bush before Mr. Pickwick had recovered his breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In with you at once, sir,&rdquo; said Sam, as he helped his master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
out. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop a second in the street, arter that &rsquo;ere exercise.
Beg your pardon, sir,&rdquo; continued Sam, touching his hat as Mr.
Winkle descended. &ldquo;Hope there warn&rsquo;t a priory &rsquo;tachment, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Winkle grasped his humble friend by the hand, and whispered
in his ear, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Sam; quite right.&rdquo; Upon which
Mr. Weller struck three distinct blows upon his nose in token of
intelligence, smiled, winked, and proceeded to put the steps up,
with a countenance expressive of lively satisfaction.</p>

<p>As to the scientific gentleman, he demonstrated, in a masterly
treatise, that these wonderful lights were the effect of electricity;
and clearly proved the same by detailing how a flash of fire danced
before his eyes when he put his head out of the gate, and how he
received a shock which stunned him for a quarter of an hour afterwards;
which demonstration delighted all the Scientific Associations
beyond measure, and caused him to be considered a light of
science ever afterwards.</p>

</div>

<p class="cap pd05"><span class="upper">The</span> remainder of the period which Mr. Pickwick had
assigned as the duration of the stay at Bath, passed
over without the occurrence of anything material.
Trinity Term commenced. On the expiration of
its first week, Mr. Pickwick and his friends returned
to London; and the former gentleman,
attended of course by Sam, straightway repaired to
his old quarters at the George and Vulture.</p>

<p>On the third morning after their arrival, just as all the clocks in
the city were striking nine individually, and somewhere about nine
hundred and ninety-nine collectively, Sam was taking the air in
George Yard, when a queer sort of fresh-painted vehicle drove up,
out of which there jumped with great agility, throwing the reins to
a stout man who sat beside him, a queer sort of gentleman, who
seemed made for the vehicle, and the vehicle for him.</p>

<p>The vehicle was not exactly a gig, neither was it a stanhope. It
was not what is currently denominated a dog-cart, neither was it a
taxed-cart, not a chaise-cart, nor a guillotined cabriolet; and yet it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
had something of the character of each and every of these machines.
It was painted a bright yellow, with the shafts and wheels picked
out in black; and the driver sat, in the orthodox sporting style,
on cushions piled about two feet above the rail. The horse was
a bay, a well-looking animal enough; but with something of a
flash and dog-fighting air about him, nevertheless, which accorded
both with the vehicle and his master.</p>

<p>The master himself was a man of about forty, with black hair,
and carefully combed whiskers. He was dressed in a particularly
gorgeous manner, with plenty of articles of jewellery about him&mdash;all
about three sizes larger than those which are usually worn by
gentlemen&mdash;and a rough great-coat to crown the whole. Into one
pocket of his great-coat he thrust his left hand the moment he
dismounted, while from the other he drew forth, with his right, a
very bright and glaring silk handkerchief, with which he whisked
a speck or two of dust from his boots, and then, crumpling it in his
hand, swaggered up the court.</p>

<p>It had not escaped Sam&rsquo;s attention that, when this person dismounted,
a shabby-looking man in a brown great-coat shorn of
divers buttons, who had been previously slinking about, on the
opposite side of the way, crossed over, and remained stationary
close by. Having something more than a suspicion of the object
of the gentleman&rsquo;s visit, Sam preceded him to the George and
Vulture, and turning sharp round, planted himself in the centre of
the doorway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, my fine fellow!&rdquo; said the man in the rough coat, in an
imperious tone, attempting at the same time to push his way past.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, sir, wot&rsquo;s the matter!&rdquo; replied Sam, returning the push
with compound interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, none of this, my man; this won&rsquo;t do with me,&rdquo; said the
owner of the rough coat, raising his voice, and turning white.
&ldquo;Here, Smouch!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, wot&rsquo;s amiss here?&rdquo; growled the man in the brown coat,
who had been gradually sneaking up the court during this short
dialogue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only some insolence of this young man&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said the principal,
giving Sam another push.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, none o&rsquo; this gammon,&rdquo; growled Smouch, giving him
another, and a harder one.</p>

<p>This last push had the effect which it was intended by the experienced
Mr. Smouch to produce; for while Sam, anxious to
return the compliment, was grinding that gentleman&rsquo;s body against
the doorpost, the principal crept past, and made his way to the
bar: whither Sam, after bandying a few epithetical remarks with
Mr. Smouch, followed at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, my dear,&rdquo; said the principal, addressing the
young lady at the bar, with Botany Bay ease, and New South
Wales gentility; &ldquo;which is Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s room, my dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Show him up,&rdquo; said the barmaid to a waiter, without deigning
another look at the exquisite, in reply to his inquiry.</p>

<p>The waiter led the way up-stairs as he was desired, and the man
in the rough coat followed, with Sam behind him: who, in his
progress up the staircase, indulged in sundry gestures indicative of
supreme contempt and defiance: to the unspeakable gratification
of the servants and other lookers-on. Mr. Smouch, who was
troubled with a hoarse cough, remained below, and expectorated
in the passage.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick was fast asleep in bed, when his early visitor,
followed by Sam, entered the room. The noise they made, in so
doing, awoke him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shaving water, Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, from within the
curtains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shave you directly, Mr. Pickwick,&rdquo; said the visitor, drawing
one of them back from the bed&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an execution
against you, at the suit of Bardell.&mdash;Here&rsquo;s the warrant.&mdash;Common
Pleas.&mdash;Here&rsquo;s my card. I suppose you&rsquo;ll come over to my house.&rdquo;
Giving Mr. Pickwick a friendly tap on the shoulder, the sheriff&rsquo;s
officer (for such he was) threw his card on the counterpane, and
pulled a gold toothpick from his waistcoat pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Namby&rsquo;s the name,&rdquo; said the sheriff&rsquo;s deputy, as Mr. Pickwick
took his spectacles from under the pillow, and put them on, to
read the card. &ldquo;Namby, Bell Alley, Coleman Street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this point Sam Weller, who had had his eyes fixed hitherto
on Mr. Namby&rsquo;s shining beaver, interfered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you a Quaker?&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you know who I am, before I&rsquo;ve done with you,&rdquo;
replied the indignant officer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you manners, my fine
fellow, one of these fine mornings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thankee,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do the same to you. Take your
hat off.&rdquo; With this, Mr. Weller, in the most dexterous manner,
knocked Mr. Namby&rsquo;s hat to the other side of the room: with such
violence, that he had very nearly caused him to swallow the gold
toothpick into the bargain.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 458px;"><a id="ill07"></a>

<div class="caption">
<p>&ldquo;Take your hat off&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Observe this, Mr. Pickwick,&rdquo; said the disconcerted officer,
gasping for breath. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been assaulted in the execution of my
dooty by your servant in your chamber. I&rsquo;m in bodily fear. I
call you to witness this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t witness nothin&rsquo;, sir,&rdquo; interposed Sam. &ldquo;Shut your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
eyes up tight, sir. I&rsquo;d pitch him out o&rsquo; winder, only he couldn&rsquo;t
fall far enough, &rsquo;cause o&rsquo; the leads outside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick in an angry voice, as the attendant
made various demonstrations of hostilities, &ldquo;if you say another
word, or offer the slightest interference with this person, I discharge
you that instant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, sir!&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;Take that
hat up again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But this Sam flatly and positively refused to do; and, after he
had been severely reprimanded by his master, the officer, being in
a hurry, condescended to pick it up himself: venting a great
variety of threats against Sam meanwhile, which that gentleman
received with perfect composure: merely observing that if Mr.
Namby would have the goodness to put his hat on again, he would
knock it into the latter end of next week. Mr. Namby, perhaps
thinking that such a process might be productive of inconvenience
to himself, declined to offer the temptation, and, soon after, called
up Smouch. Having informed him that the capture was made,
and that he was to wait for the prisoner until he should have
finished dressing, Namby then swaggered out, and drove away.
Smouch, requesting Mr. Pickwick in a surly manner &ldquo;to be as alive
as he could, for it was a busy time,&rdquo; drew up a chair by the door,
and sat there, until he had finished dressing. Sam was then despatched
for a hackney-coach, and in it the triumvirate proceeded
to Coleman Street. It was fortunate the distance was short; for
Mr. Smouch, besides possessing no very enchanting conversational
powers, was rendered a decidedly unpleasant companion in a limited
space, by the physical weakness to which we have elsewhere adverted.</p>

<p>The coach having turned into a very narrow and dark street,
stopped before a house with iron bars to all the windows; the
door-posts of which were graced by the name and title of &ldquo;Namby,
Officer to the Sheriffs of London:&rdquo; the inner gate having been
opened by a gentleman who might have passed for a neglected twin
brother of Mr. Smouch, and who was endowed with a large key for
the purpose, Mr. Pickwick was shown into the &ldquo;coffee-room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This coffee-room was a front parlour: the principal features of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
which were fresh sand and stale tobacco smoke. Mr. Pickwick
bowed to the three persons who were seated in it when he entered
and having despatched Sam for Perker, withdrew into an obscure
corner, and from thence looked with some curiosity upon his new
companions.</p>

<p>One of these was a mere boy of nineteen or twenty, who, though
it was yet barely ten o&rsquo;clock, was drinking gin and water, and
smoking a cigar: amusements to which, judging from his inflamed
countenance, he had devoted himself pretty constantly for the last
year or two of his life. Opposite him, engaged in stirring the fire
with the toe of his right boot, was a coarse vulgar young man of
about thirty, with a sallow face and harsh voice: evidently possessed
of that knowledge of the world, and captivating freedom of
manner, which is to be acquired in public-house parlours, and at
low billiard-tables. The third tenant of the apartment was a
middle-aged man in a very old suit of black, who looked pale and
haggard, and paced up and down the room incessantly: stopping,
now and then, to look with great anxiety out of the window as if
he expected somebody, and then resuming his walk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better have the loan of my razor this morning, Mr.
Ayresleigh,&rdquo; said the man who was stirring the fire, tipping the
wink to his friend the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, no, I shan&rsquo;t want it; I expect I shall be out in the
course of an hour or so,&rdquo; replied the other in a hurried manner.
Then, walking again up to the window, and once more returning
disappointed, he sighed deeply, and left the room; upon which
the other two burst into a loud laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I never saw such a game as that,&rdquo; said the gentleman
who had offered the razor, whose name appeared to be Price.
&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; Mr. Price confirmed the assertion with an oath, and
then laughed again, when of course the boy (who thought his
companion one of the most dashing fellows alive) laughed also.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d hardly think, would you now,&rdquo; said Price, turning
towards Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;that that chap&rsquo;s been here a week yesterday,
and never once shaved himself yet, because he feels so certain he&rsquo;s
going out in half an hour&rsquo;s time, that he thinks he may as well put
it off till he gets home?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor man!&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;Are his chances of getting
out of his difficulties really so great?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chances be d&mdash;d,&rdquo; replied Price; &ldquo;he hasn&rsquo;t half the ghost of
one. I wouldn&rsquo;t give <em>that</em> for his chance of walking about the
streets this time ten years.&rdquo; With this Mr. Price snapped his
fingers contemptuously, and rang the bell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me a sheet of paper, Crookey,&rdquo; said Mr. Price to the
attendant, who in dress and general appearance looked something
between a bankrupt grazier, and a drover in a state of insolvency;
&ldquo;and a glass of brandy and water, Crookey, d&rsquo;ye hear? I&rsquo;m going
to write to my father, and I must have a stimulant, or I shan&rsquo;t
be able to pitch it strong enough into the old boy.&rdquo; At this
facetious speech, the young boy, it is almost needless to say, was
fairly convulsed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Mr. Price. &ldquo;Never say die. All fun,
ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prime!&rdquo; said the young gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve some spirit about you, you have,&rdquo; said Price.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen something of life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rather think I have!&rdquo; replied the boy. He had looked at it
through the dirty panes of glass in a bar door.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick feeling not a little disgusted with this dialogue, as
well as with the air and manner of the two beings by whom it had
been carried on, was about to inquire whether he could not be
accommodated with a private sitting-room, when two or three
strangers of genteel appearance entered, at sight of whom the boy
threw his cigar into the fire, and whispering to Mr. Price that they
had come to &ldquo;make it all right&rdquo; for him, joined them at a table in
the further end of the room.</p>

<p>It would appear, however, that matters were not going to
be made all right quite so speedily as the young gentleman
anticipated; for a very long conversation ensued, of which Mr.
Pickwick could not avoid hearing certain fragments regarding dissolute
conduct, and repeated forgiveness. At last there were very
distinct allusions made by the oldest gentleman of the party to
one Whitecross Street, at which the young gentleman, notwithstanding
his primeness and his spirit, and his knowledge of life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
into the bargain, reclined his head upon the table, and howled
dismally.</p>

<p>Very much satisfied with this sudden bringing down of the
youth&rsquo;s valour, and this effectual lowering of his tone, Mr. Pickwick
rang the bell, and was shown, at his own request, into a private room
furnished with a carpet, table, chairs, sideboard, and sofa, and ornamented
with a looking-glass, and various old prints. Here he had
the advantage of hearing Mrs. Namby&rsquo;s performance on a square
piano overhead, while the breakfast was getting ready; when it
came, Mr. Perker came too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aha, my dear sir,&rdquo; said the little man, &ldquo;nailed at last, eh?
Come, come, I&rsquo;m not sorry for it either, because now you&rsquo;ll see the
absurdity of this conduct. I&rsquo;ve noted down the amount of the
taxed costs and damages for which the <em>ca-sa</em> was issued, and we
had better settle at once and lose no time. Namby is come home
by this time, I dare say. What say you, my dear sir? Shall
I draw a cheque, or will you?&rdquo; The little man rubbed his hands
with affected cheerfulness as he said this, but glancing at Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s countenance, could not forbear at the same time casting
a desponding look towards Sam Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perker,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;let me hear no more of this,
I beg. I see no advantage in staying here, so I shall go to prison
to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go to Whitecross Street, my dear sir,&rdquo; said Perker.
&ldquo;Impossible! There are sixty beds in a ward; and the bolt&rsquo;s on
sixteen hours out of the four-and-twenty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would rather go to some other place of confinement if I can,&rdquo;
said Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;If not, I must make the best I can of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can go to the Fleet, my dear sir, if you&rsquo;re determined to
go somewhere,&rdquo; said Perker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go there directly I have
finished my breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop, stop, my dear sir; not the least occasion for being in
such a violent hurry to get into a place that most other men are
as eager to get out of,&rdquo; said the good-natured little attorney.
&ldquo;We must have a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">habeas corpus</i>. There&rsquo;ll be no judge at chambers
till four o&rsquo;clock this afternoon. You must wait till then.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with unmoved patience.
&ldquo;Then we will have a chop, here, at two. See about it, Sam, and
tell them to be punctual.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick remaining firm, despite all the remonstrances and
arguments of Perker, the chops appeared and disappeared in due
course; he was then put into another hackney-coach, and carried
off to Chancery Lane, after waiting half an hour or so for Mr.
Namby, who had a select dinner-party and could on no account be
disturbed before.</p>

<p>There were two judges in attendance at Serjeant&rsquo;s Inn&mdash;one
King&rsquo;s Bench, and one Common Pleas&mdash;and a great deal of business
appeared to be transacting before them, if the number of lawyers&rsquo;
clerks who were hurrying in and out with bundles of papers,
afforded any test. When they reached the low archway which
forms the entrance to the Inn, Perker was detained a few moments
parleying with the coachman about the fare and the change; and
Mr. Pickwick, stepping to one side to be out of the way of the
stream of people that were pouring in and out, looked about him
with some curiosity.</p>

<p>The people that attracted his attention most, were three or four
men of shabby-genteel appearance, who touched their hats to many
of the attorneys who passed, and seemed to have some business
there, the nature of which Mr. Pickwick could not divine. They
were curious-looking fellows. One was a slim and rather lame
man in rusty black, and a white neckerchief; another was a stout
burly person, dressed in the same apparel, with a great reddish-black
cloth round his neck; a third was a little weazen drunken-looking
body, with a pimply face. They were loitering about, with
their hands behind them, and now and then with an anxious
countenance whispered something in the ear of some of the gentlemen
with papers, as they hurried by. Mr. Pickwick remembered
to have very often observed them lounging under the archway
when he had been walking past; and his curiosity was quite
excited to know to what branch of the profession these dingy-looking
loungers could possibly belong.</p>

<p>He was about to propound the question to Namby, who kept
close beside him, sucking a large gold ring on his little finger, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Perker bustled up, and observing that there was no time to lose,
led the way into the Inn. As Mr. Pickwick followed, the lame
man stepped up to him, and civilly touching his hat, held out a
written card, which Mr. Pickwick, not wishing to hurt the man&rsquo;s
feelings by refusing, courteously accepted and deposited in his
waistcoat pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Perker, turning round before he entered one of the
offices, to see that his companions were close behind him. &ldquo;In
here, my dear sir. Hallo, what do <em>you</em> want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This last question was addressed to the lame man, who, unobserved
by Mr. Pickwick, made one of the party. In reply to it,
the lame man touched his hat again, with all imaginable politeness,
and motioned towards Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Perker, with a smile. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want you,
my dear friend, we don&rsquo;t want you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rdquo; said the lame man. &ldquo;The gentleman
took my card. I hope you will employ me, sir. The gentleman
nodded to me. I&rsquo;ll be judged by the gentleman himself. You
nodded to me, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh, pooh, nonsense. You didn&rsquo;t nod to anybody, Pickwick?
A mistake, a mistake,&rdquo; said Perker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gentleman handed me his card,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick,
producing it from his waistcoat pocket. &ldquo;I accepted it, as the
gentleman seemed to wish it&mdash;in fact I had some curiosity to look
at it when I should be at leisure. <span class="nobreak">I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>The little attorney burst into a loud laugh, and returning the
card to the lame man, informing him it was all a mistake, whispered
to Mr. Pickwick as the man turned away in dudgeon, that he was
only a bail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A what!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A bail,&rdquo; replied Perker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A bail!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear sir&mdash;half a dozen of &rsquo;em here. Bail you to any
amount, and only charge half-a-crown. Curious trade, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
said Perker, regaling himself with a pinch of snuff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! Am I to understand that these men earn a livelihood
by waiting about here, to perjure themselves before the judges of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the land, at the rate of half-a-crown a crime!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr.
Pickwick, quite aghast at the disclosure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t exactly know about perjury, my dear sir,&rdquo;
replied the little gentleman. &ldquo;Harsh word, my dear sir, very harsh
word indeed. It&rsquo;s a legal fiction, my dear sir, nothing more.&rdquo;
Saying which the attorney shrugged his shoulders, smiled, took a
second pinch of snuff, and led the way into the office of the judge&rsquo;s
clerk.</p>

<p>This was a room of specially dirty appearance, with a very low
ceiling and old panelled walls; and so badly lighted, that although
it was broad day outside, great tallow candles were burning on the
desks. At one end was a door leading to the judge&rsquo;s private
apartment, round which were congregated a crowd of attorneys and
managing clerks, who were called in, in the order in which their
respective appointments stood upon the file. Every time this door
was opened to let a party out, the next party made a violent rush
to get in; and, as in addition to the numerous dialogues which
passed between the gentlemen who were waiting to see the judge,
a variety of personal squabbles ensued between the greater part of
those who had seen him, there was as much noise as could well be
raised in an apartment of such confined dimensions.</p>

<p>Nor were the conversations of these gentlemen the only sounds
that broke upon the ear. Standing on a box behind a wooden bar
at another end of the room, was a clerk in spectacles, who was
&ldquo;taking the affidavits:&rdquo; large batches of which were, from time
to time, carried into the private room by another clerk for the
judge&rsquo;s signature. There were a large number of attorneys&rsquo; clerks
to be sworn, and it being a moral impossibility to swear them all at
once, the struggles of these gentlemen to reach the clerk in spectacles,
were like those of a crowd to get in at the pit door of a
theatre when Gracious Majesty honours it with its presence.
Another functionary, from time to time, exercised his lungs in
calling over the names of those who had been sworn, for the purpose
of restoring to them their affidavits after they had been signed by
the judge: which gave rise to a few more scuffles; and all these
things going on at the same time, occasioned as much bustle as the
most active and excitable person could desire to behold. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
were yet another class of persons&mdash;those who were waiting to
attend summonses their employers had taken out, which it was
optional to the attorney on the opposite side to attend or not&mdash;and
whose business it was, from time to time, to cry out the opposite
attorney&rsquo;s name; to make certain that he was not in attendance
without their knowledge.</p>

<p>For example. Leaning against the wall, close beside the seat
Mr. Pickwick had taken, was an office-lad of fourteen, with a tenor
voice; near him, a common-law clerk with a bass one.</p>

<p>A clerk hurried in with a bundle of papers, and stared about
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sniggle and Blink,&rdquo; cried the tenor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Porkin and Snob,&rdquo; growled the bass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stumpy and Deacon,&rdquo; said the new comer.</p>

<p>Nobody answered; the next man who came in, was hailed by
the whole three; and he in his turn shouted for another firm; and
then somebody else roared in a loud voice for another; and so forth.</p>

<p>All this time, the man in the spectacles was hard at work,
swearing the clerks: the oath being invariably administered without
any effort at the punctuation, and usually in the following terms:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take the book in your right hand this is your name and
hand-writing you swear that the contents of this your affidavit
are true so help you God a shilling you must get change I haven&rsquo;t
got it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;I suppose they are getting the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">habeas corpus</i> ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;and I vish they&rsquo;d bring out the have-his-carcase.
It&rsquo;s wery unpleasant keepin&rsquo; us vaitin&rsquo; here. I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo;
got half a dozen have-his-carcases ready, pack&rsquo;d up and all, by
this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What sort of cumbrous and unmanageable machine Sam Weller
imagined a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">habeas corpus</i> to be, does not appear; for Perker, at
that moment, walked up, and took Mr. Pickwick away.</p>

<p>The usual forms having been gone through, the body of Samuel
Pickwick was soon afterwards confided to the custody of the
tipstaff, to be by him taken to the Warden of the Fleet Prison,
and there detained until the amount of the damages and costs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
in the action of Bardell against Pickwick was fully paid and
satisfied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, laughing, &ldquo;will be a very long
time. Sam, call another hackney-coach. Perker, my dear friend,
good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall go with you, and see you safe there,&rdquo; said Perker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;I would rather go without
any other attendant than Sam. As soon as I get settled, I will
write and let you know, and I shall expect you immediately. Until
then, good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Mr. Pickwick said this, he got into the coach which had by
this time arrived: followed by the tipstaff. Sam having stationed
himself on the box, it rolled away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A most extraordinary man that!&rdquo; said Perker, as he stopped
to pull on his gloves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a bankrupt he&rsquo;d make, sir,&rdquo; observed Mr. Lowten, who
was standing near. &ldquo;How he would bother the commissioners!
He&rsquo;d set &rsquo;em at defiance if they talked of committing him, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The attorney did not appear very much delighted with his
clerk&rsquo;s professional estimate of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s character, for he
walked away without deigning any reply.</p>

<p>The hackney-coach jolted along Fleet Street, as hackney-coaches
usually do. The horses &ldquo;went better,&rdquo; the driver said,
when they had anything before them (they must have gone at a
most extraordinary pace when there was nothing), and so the
vehicle kept behind a cart; when the cart stopped, it stopped; and
when the cart went on again, it did the same. Mr. Pickwick sat
opposite the tipstaff; and the tipstaff sat with his hat between his
knees, whistling a tune, and looking out of the coach window.</p>

<p>Time performs wonders. By the powerful old gentleman&rsquo;s aid,
even a hackney-coach gets over half a mile of ground. They
stopped at length, and Mr. Pickwick alighted at the gate of the
Fleet.</p>

<p>The tipstaff, looking over his shoulder to see that his charge was
following close at his heels, preceded Mr. Pickwick into the prison;
turning to the left, after they had entered, they passed through an
open door into a lobby, from which a heavy gate, opposite to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
by which they had entered and which was guarded by a stout
turnkey with a key in his hand, led at once into the interior of
the prison.</p>

<p>Here they stopped, while the tipstaff delivered his papers; and
here Mr. Pickwick was apprised that he would remain, until he had
undergone the ceremony, known to the initiated as &ldquo;sitting for
your portrait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sitting for my portrait!&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Having your likeness taken, sir,&rdquo; replied the stout turnkey.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re capital hands at likenesses here. Take &rsquo;em in no time, and
always exact. Walk in, sir, and make yourself at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick complied with the invitation, and sat himself
down: and Mr. Weller, who stationed himself at the back of the
chair, whispered that the sitting was merely another term for
undergoing an inspection by the different turnkeys, in order that
they might know prisoners from visitors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;then I wish the artists would
come. This is rather a public place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They von&rsquo;t be long, sir, I des-say,&rdquo; replied Sam. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a
Dutch clock, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I see,&rdquo; observed Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a bird-cage, sir,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;Veels vithin veels, a prison
in a prison. Ain&rsquo;t it, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Mr. Weller made this philosophical remark, Mr. Pickwick
was aware that the sitting had commenced. The stout turnkey
having been relieved from the lock, sat down, and looked at him
carelessly from time to time, while a long thin man who had
relieved him, thrust his hands beneath his coat-tails, and planting
himself opposite, took a good long view of him. A third rather
surly-looking gentleman: who had apparently been disturbed at
his tea, for he was disposing of the last remnant of a crust and
butter when he came in: stationed himself close to Mr. Pickwick;
and, resting his hands on his hips, inspected him narrowly; while
two others mixed with the group, and studied his features with
most intent and thoughtful faces. Mr. Pickwick winced a good
deal under the operation, and appeared to sit very uneasily in his
chair; but he made no remark to anybody while it was being performed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
not even to Sam, who reclined upon the back of the chair,
reflecting, partly on the situation of his master, and partly on the
great satisfaction it would have afforded him to make a fierce
assault upon all the turnkeys there assembled, one after the other,
if it were lawful and peaceable to do so.</p>

<p>At length the likeness was completed, and Mr. Pickwick was
informed, that he might now proceed into the prison.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where am I to sleep to-night?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why I don&rsquo;t rightly know about to-night,&rdquo; replied the stout
turnkey. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be chummed on somebody to-morrow, and then
you&rsquo;ll be all snug and comfortable. The first night&rsquo;s generally
rather unsettled, but you&rsquo;ll be set all squares to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After some discussion, it was discovered that one of the turnkeys
had a bed to let, which Mr. Pickwick could have for that night.
He gladly agreed to hire it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll come with me, I&rsquo;ll show it you at once,&rdquo; said the
man. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t a large &rsquo;un; but it&rsquo;s an out-and-outer to sleep in.
This way, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They passed through the inner gate, and descended a short
flight of steps. The key was turned after them; and Mr. Pickwick
found himself, for the first time in his life, within the walls of a
debtor&rsquo;s prison.</p>

<p class="cap pd10"><span class="upper">Mr. Tom Roker</span>,
the gentleman
who had accompanied
Mr. Pickwick into the
prison, turned
sharp round to the right when he
got to the bottom of the little
flight of steps, and led the way, through an iron gate which
stood open, and up another short flight of steps, into a long
narrow gallery, dirty and low, paved with stone, and very dimly
lighted by a window at each remote end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said the gentleman, thrusting his hands into his pockets,
and looking carelessly over his shoulder to Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;this
here is the hall flight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, looking down a dark and filthy
staircase, which appeared to lead to a range of damp and gloomy
stone vaults, beneath the ground, &ldquo;and those, I suppose, are the
little cellars where the prisoners keep their small quantities of coals.
Unpleasant places to have to go down to; but very convenient, I
dare say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if they was convenient,&rdquo; replied the
gentleman, &ldquo;seeing that a few people live there, pretty snug.
That&rsquo;s the Fair, that is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t really mean to say
that human beings live down in those wretched dungeons?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; replied Mr. Roker, with indignant astonishment;
&ldquo;why shouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Live! Live down there!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Live down there! Yes, and die down there, too, wery
often!&rdquo; replied Mr. Roker; &ldquo;and what of that? Who&rsquo;s got to
say anything agin it? Live down there! Yes, and a wery good
place it is to live in, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Roker turned somewhat fiercely upon Mr. Pickwick in saying
this, and, moreover, muttered in an excited fashion certain unpleasant
invocations concerning his own eyes, limbs, and circulating
fluids, the latter gentleman deemed it advisable to pursue the discourse
no further. Mr. Roker then proceeded to mount another
staircase, as dirty as that which led to the place which had just
been the subject of discussion, in which ascent he was closely
followed by Mr. Pickwick and Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Mr. Roker, pausing for breath when they reached
another gallery of the same dimensions as the one below, &ldquo;this is
the coffee-room flight; the one above&rsquo;s the third, and the one above
that&rsquo;s the top; and the room where you&rsquo;re a-going to sleep to-night
is the warden&rsquo;s room, and it&rsquo;s this way&mdash;come on.&rdquo; Having
said all this in a breath, Mr. Roker mounted another flight of
stairs, with Mr. Pickwick and Sam Weller following at his heels.</p>

<p>These staircases received light from sundry windows placed at
some little distance above the floor, and looking into a gravelled
area bounded by a high brick wall, with iron <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chevaux-de-frise</i> at the
top. This area, it appeared from Mr. Roker&rsquo;s statement, was the
racket-ground; and it further appeared, on the testimony of the
same gentleman, that there was a smaller area in that portion of
the prison which was nearest Farringdon Street, denominated and
called the &ldquo;Painted Ground,&rdquo; from the fact of its walls having once
displayed the semblances of various men-of-war in full sail, and
other artistical effects achieved in bygone times by some imprisoned
draughtsman in his leisure hours.</p>

<p>Having communicated this piece of information, apparently
more for the purpose of discharging his bosom of an important fact,
than with any specific view of enlightening Mr. Pickwick, the guide,
having at length reached another gallery, led the way into a small
passage at the extreme end: opened a door: and disclosed an
apartment of an appearance by no means inviting, containing eight
or nine iron bedsteads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Mr. Roker, holding the door open, and looking
triumphantly round at Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a room!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s face, however, betokened such a very trifling
portion of satisfaction at the appearance of his lodging, that Mr.
Roker looked for a reciprocity of feeling into the countenance of
Samuel Weller, who, until now, had observed a dignified silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a room, young man,&rdquo; observed Mr. Roker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see it,&rdquo; replied Sam, with a placid nod of the head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t think to find such a room as this in the
Farringdon Hotel, would you?&rdquo; said Mr. Roker, with a complacent
smile.</p>

<p>To this Mr. Weller replied with an easy and unstudied closing
of one eye; which might be considered to mean, either that he
would have thought it, or that he would not have thought it, or
that he had never thought anything at all about it: as the observer&rsquo;s
imagination suggested. Having executed this feat, and re-opened
his eye, Mr. Weller proceeded to inquire which was the individual
bedstead that Mr. Roker had so flatteringly described as an out-and-outer
to sleep in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; replied Mr. Roker, pointing to a very rusty one in a
corner. &ldquo;It would make any one go to sleep, that bedstead would,
whether they wanted to or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think,&rdquo; said Sam, eyeing the piece of furniture in
question with a look of excessive disgust, &ldquo;I should think poppies
was nothing to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all,&rdquo; said Mr. Roker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I s&rsquo;pose,&rdquo; said Sam, with a sidelong glance at his master,
as if to see whether there were any symptoms of his determination
being shaken by what passed, &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose the other gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n as
sleeps here, <em>are</em> gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing but it,&rdquo; said Mr. Roker. &ldquo;One of &rsquo;em takes his
twelve pints of ale a-day, and never leaves off smoking even at
his meals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must be a first-rater,&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A 1,&rdquo; replied Mr. Roker.</p>

<p>Nothing daunted, even by this intelligence, Mr. Pickwick
smilingly announced his determination to test the powers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
narcotic bedstead for that night; and Mr. Roker, after informing
him that he could retire to rest at whatever hour he thought proper,
without any further notice or formality, walked off, leaving him
standing with Sam in the gallery.</p>

<p>It was getting dark; that is to say, a few gas jets were kindled
in this place which was never light, by way of compliment to the
evening, which had set in outside. As it was rather warm, some of
the tenants of the numerous little rooms which opened into the
gallery on either hand, had set their doors ajar. Mr. Pickwick
peeped into them as he passed along, with great curiosity and
interest. Here four or five great hulking fellows, just visible
through a cloud of tobacco-smoke, were engaged in noisy and
riotous conversation over half-emptied pots of beer, or playing at
all-fours with a very greasy pack of cards. In the adjoining room,
some solitary tenant might be seen, poring, by the light of a feeble
tallow candle, over a bundle of soiled and tattered papers, yellow
with dust and dropping to pieces from age: writing, for the
hundredth time, some lengthened statement of his grievances, for
the perusal of some great man whose eyes it would never reach, or
whose heart it would never touch. In a third, a man, with his
wife and a whole crowd of children, might be seen making up a
scanty bed on the ground, or upon a few chairs, for the younger
ones to pass the night in. And in a fourth, and a fifth, and a
sixth, and a seventh, the noise and the beer, and the tobacco-smoke,
and the cards, all came over again in greater force than
before.</p>

<p>In the galleries themselves, and more especially on the staircases,
there lingered a great number of people, who came there,
some because their rooms were empty and lonesome, others because
their rooms were full and hot: the greater part because they were
restless and uncomfortable, and not possessed of the secret of
exactly knowing what to do with themselves. There were many
classes of people here, from the labouring man in his fustian jacket,
to the broken-down spendthrift in his shawl dressing-gown, most
appropriately out at elbows; but there was the same air about them
all&mdash;a listless, jail-bird, careless swagger, a vagabondish who&rsquo;s-afraid
sort of bearing, which is wholly indescribable in words, but which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
any man can understand in one moment if he wish, by setting foot
in the nearest debtor&rsquo;s prison, and looking at the very first group
of people he sees there, with the same interest as Mr. Pickwick did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It strikes me, Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, leaning over the iron
rail at the stair-head&mdash;&ldquo;it strikes me, Sam, that imprisonment for
debt is scarcely any punishment at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think not, sir?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see how these fellows drink, and smoke, and roar,&rdquo;
replied Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite impossible that they can mind
it much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s just the wery thing, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Sam, &ldquo;<em>they</em> don&rsquo;t
mind it; it&rsquo;s a regular holiday to them&mdash;all porter and skittles.
It&rsquo;s the t&rsquo;other vuns as gets done over, vith this sort o&rsquo; thing: them
down-hearted fellers as can&rsquo;t svig avay at the beer, nor play at
skittles neither; them as vould pay if they could, and gets low by
being boxed up. I&rsquo;ll tell you wot it is, sir; them as is alvays a
idlin&rsquo; in public-houses it don&rsquo;t damage at all, and them as is alvays
a workin&rsquo; ven they can, it damages too much. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s unekal,&rsquo; as
my father used to say ven his grog worn&rsquo;t made half-and-half.
It&rsquo;s unekal, and that&rsquo;s the fault on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re right, Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, after a few
moments&rsquo; reflection, &ldquo;quite right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;raps, now and then, there&rsquo;s some honest people as likes it,&rdquo;
observed Mr. Weller, in a ruminative tone, &ldquo;but I never heerd o&rsquo;
one as I can call to mind, &rsquo;cept the little dirty-faced man in the
brown coat; and that wos force of habit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who was he?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vy, that&rsquo;s just the wery point as nobody never know&rsquo;d,&rdquo;
replied Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what did he do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vy, he did wot many men as has been much better know&rsquo;d has
done in their time, sir,&rdquo; replied Sam, &ldquo;he run a match agin the
constable, and vun it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In other words, I suppose,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;he got into
debt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just that, sir,&rdquo; replied Sam, &ldquo;and in course o&rsquo; time he come
here in consekens. It warn&rsquo;t much&mdash;execution for nine pound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
nothin&rsquo;, multiplied by five for costs; but hows&rsquo;ever here he stopped
for seventeen year. If he got any wrinkles in his face, they wos
stopped up vith the dirt, for both the dirty face and the brown coat
wos just the same at the end o&rsquo; that time as they wos at the
beginnin&rsquo;. He wos a wery peaceful inoffendin&rsquo; little creetur, and
wos alvays a bustlin&rsquo; about for somebody, or playin&rsquo; rackets and
never vinnin&rsquo;; till at last the turnkeys they got quite fond on him,
and he wos in the lodge ev&rsquo;ry night, a chattering vith &rsquo;em, and
tellin&rsquo; stories, and all that &rsquo;ere. Vun night he wos in there as usual,
along vith a wery old friend of his, as wos on the lock, ven he says
all of a sudden, &lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t seen the market outside, Bill,&rsquo; he says
(Fleet Market wos there at that time)&mdash;&lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t seen the market
outside, Bill,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;for seventeen year.&rsquo; &lsquo;I know you ain&rsquo;t,&rsquo; says
the turnkey, smoking his pipe. &lsquo;I should like to see it for a minit,
Bill,&rsquo; he says. &lsquo;Wery probable,&rsquo; says the turnkey, smoking his pipe
wery fierce, and making believe he warn&rsquo;t up to what the little man
wanted. &lsquo;Bill,&rsquo; says the little man, more abrupt than afore, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
got the fancy in my head. Let me see the public streets once
more afore I die; and if I ain&rsquo;t struck with apoplexy, I&rsquo;ll be back
in five minits by the clock.&rsquo; &lsquo;And wot &rsquo;ud become o&rsquo; me if you
<em>wos</em> struck with apoplexy?&rsquo; said the turnkey. &rsquo;Vy,&rsquo; says the
little creetur, &rsquo;whoever found me, &rsquo;ud bring me home, for I&rsquo;ve got
my card in my pocket, Bill,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;No. 20, Coffee-room Flight:&rsquo;
and that wos true, sure enough, for ven he wanted to make the
acquaintance of any new comer, he used to pull out a little limp
card vith them words on it and nothin&rsquo; else; in consideration of
vich, he wos alvays called Number Tventy. The turnkey takes
a fixed look at him, and at last he says in a solemn manner,
&lsquo;Tventy,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll trust you; you won&rsquo;t get your old friend
into trouble?&rsquo; &lsquo;No, my boy; I hope I&rsquo;ve somethin&rsquo; better behind
here,&rsquo; says the little man; and as he said it he hit his little veskit
wery hard, and then a tear started out o&rsquo; each eye, which wos wery
extraordinary, for it was supposed as water never touched his face.
He shook the turnkey by the hand; out he <span class="nobreak">vent&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And never came back again?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wrong for vunce, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller, &ldquo;for back he come,
two minits afore the time, a bilin&rsquo; with rage: sayin&rsquo; how he&rsquo;d been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
nearly run over by a hackney-coach: that he warn&rsquo;t used to it:
and he wos blowed if he wouldn&rsquo;t write to the Lord Mayor. They
got him pacified at last; and for five years arter that, he never even
so much as peeped out o&rsquo; the lodge gate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the expiration of that time he died, I suppose?&rdquo; said Mr.
Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t, sir,&rdquo; replied Sam. &ldquo;He got a curiosity to go
and taste the beer at a new public-house over the way, and it wos
such a wery nice parlour, that he took it into his head to go there
every night, vich he did for a long time, always comin&rsquo; back
reg&rsquo;lar about a quarter of an hour afore the gate shut, vich wos all
wery snug and comfortable. At last he began to get so precious
jolly, that he used to forget how the time vent, or care nothin&rsquo; at
all about it, and he vent on gettin&rsquo; later and later, till vun night his
old friend wos just a shuttin&rsquo; the gate&mdash;had turned the key in fact&mdash;ven
he come up. &lsquo;Hold hard, Bill,&rsquo; he says. &lsquo;Wot, ain&rsquo;t you
come home yet, Tventy?&rsquo; says the turnkey; &lsquo;I thought you wos
in, long ago.&rsquo; &lsquo;No, I wasn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; says the little man, vith a smile.
&lsquo;Well then, I&rsquo;ll tell you wot it is, my friend,&rsquo; says the turnkey,
openin&rsquo; the gate wery slow and sulky, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s my &rsquo;pinion as you&rsquo;ve
got into bad company o&rsquo; late, which I&rsquo;m wery sorry to see. Now,
I don&rsquo;t wish to do nothing harsh,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;but if you can&rsquo;t confine
yourself to steady circles, and find your vay back at reg&rsquo;lar hours,
as sure as you&rsquo;re a standin&rsquo; there, I&rsquo;ll shut you out altogether!&rsquo;
The little man was seized vith a wiolent fit o&rsquo; tremblin&rsquo;, and never
vent outside the prison walls artervards!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Sam concluded, Mr. Pickwick slowly retraced his steps down-stairs.
After a few thoughtful turns in the Painted Ground, which,
as it was now dark, was nearly deserted, he intimated to Mr. Weller
that he thought it high time for him to withdraw for the night;
requesting him to seek a bed in some adjacent public-house, and
return early in the morning, to make arrangements for the removal
of his master&rsquo;s wardrobe from the George and Vulture. This
request Mr. Samuel Weller prepared to obey, with as good a grace
as he could assume, but with a very considerable show of reluctance
nevertheless. He even went so far as to essay sundry ineffectual
hints regarding the expediency of stretching himself on the gravel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
for that night; but finding Mr. Pickwick obstinately deaf to any
such suggestions, finally withdrew.</p>

<p>There is no disguising the fact that Mr. Pickwick felt very
low-spirited and uncomfortable; not for lack of society, for the
prison was very full, and a bottle of wine would at once have
purchased the utmost good-fellowship of a few choice spirits,
without any more formal ceremony of introduction; but he was
alone in the coarse, vulgar crowd, and felt the depression of spirit
and sinking of heart, naturally consequent on the reflection that
he was cooped and caged up, without a prospect of liberation.
As to the idea of releasing himself by ministering to the sharpness
of Dodson and Fogg, it never for an instant entered his
thoughts.</p>

<p>In this frame of mind he turned again into the coffee-room
gallery, and walked slowly to and fro. The place was intolerably
dirty, and the smell of tobacco-smoke perfectly suffocating. There
was a perpetual slamming and banging of doors as the people went
in and out; and the noise of their voices and footsteps echoed
and re-echoed through the passages constantly. A young woman,
with a child in her arms, who seemed scarcely able to crawl, from
emaciation and misery, was walking up and down the passage in
conversation with her husband, who had no other place to see
her in. As they passed Mr. Pickwick, he could hear the female
sob; and once she burst into such a passion of grief, that she
was compelled to lean against the wall for support, while the man
took the child in his arms, and tried to soothe her.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s heart was really too full to bear it, and he went
up-stairs to bed.</p>

<p>Now, although the warden&rsquo;s room was a very uncomfortable one
(being, in every point of decoration and convenience, several
hundred degrees inferior to the common infirmary of a county gaol),
it had at present the merit of being wholly deserted save by Mr.
Pickwick himself. So, he sat down at the foot of his little iron
bedstead, and began to wonder how much a year the warden made
out of the dirty room. Having satisfied himself, by mathematical
calculation, that the apartment was about equal in annual value to
the freehold of a small street in the suburbs of London, he took to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
wondering what possible temptation could have induced a dingy-looking
fly that was crawling over his pantaloons, to come into a
close prison, when he had the choice of so many airy situations&mdash;a
course of meditation which led him to the irresistible conclusion
that the insect was mad. After settling this point, he began to be
conscious that he was getting sleepy; whereupon he took his
nightcap out of the pocket in which he had had the precaution to
stow it in the morning, and, leisurely undressing himself, got into
bed, and fell asleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bravo! Heel over toe&mdash;cut and shuffle&mdash;pay away at it,
Zephyr! I&rsquo;m smothered if the Opera House isn&rsquo;t your proper
hemisphere. Keep it up! Hooray!&rdquo; These expressions, delivered
in a most boisterous tone, and accompanied with loud
peals of laughter, roused Mr. Pickwick from one of those sound
slumbers which, lasting in reality some half-hour, seem to the
sleeper to have been protracted for three weeks or a month.</p>

<p>The voice had no sooner ceased than the room was shaken with
such violence that the windows rattled in their frames, and the
bedsteads trembled again. Mr. Pickwick started up, and remained
for some minutes fixed in mute astonishment at the scene
before him.</p>

<p>On the floor of the room, a man in a broad-skirted green coat,
with corduroy knee smalls and grey cotton stockings, was performing
the most popular steps of a hornpipe, with a slang and burlesque
caricature of grace and lightness, which, combined with the very
appropriate character of his costume, was inexpressibly absurd.
Another man, evidently very drunk, who had probably been
tumbled into bed by his companions, was sitting up between the
sheets, warbling as much as he could recollect of a comic song,
with the most intensely sentimental feeling and expression; while
a third, seated on one of the bedsteads, was applauding both performers
with the air of a profound connoisseur, and encouraging
them by such ebullitions of feeling as had already roused Mr.
Pickwick from his sleep.</p>

<p>This last man was an admirable specimen of a class of gentry
which never can be seen in full perfection but in such places;&mdash;they
may be met with, in an imperfect state, occasionally about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
stable-yards and public-houses; but they never attain their full
bloom except in these hot-beds, which would almost seem to be
considerately provided by the Legislature for the sole purpose of
rearing them.</p>

<p>He was a tall fellow, with an olive complexion, long dark hair,
and very thick bushy whiskers meeting under his chin. He wore
no neckerchief, as he had been playing rackets all day, and his
open shirt-collar displayed their full luxuriance. On his head he
wore one of the common eighteenpenny French skull-caps, with a
gaudy tassel dangling therefrom, very happily in keeping with a
common fustian coat. His legs: which, being long, were afflicted
with weakness: graced a pair of Oxford-mixture trousers, made to
show the full symmetry of those limbs. Being somewhat negligently
braced, however, and, moreover, but imperfectly buttoned,
they fell in a series of not the most graceful folds over a pair of
shoes sufficiently down at the heel to display a pair of very soiled
white stockings. There was a rakish, vagabond smartness, and a
kind of boastful rascality, about the whole man, that was worth a
mine of gold.</p>

<p>This figure was the first to perceive that Mr. Pickwick was
looking on; upon which he winked to the Zephyr, and entreated
him, with mock gravity, not to wake the gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, bless the gentleman&rsquo;s honest heart and soul!&rdquo; said the
Zephyr, turning round and affecting the extremity of surprise;
&ldquo;the gentleman <em>is</em> awake. Hem, Shakespeare! How do you do,
sir? How is Mary and Sarah, sir? and the dear old lady at home,
sir? Will you have the kindness to put my compliments into the
first little parcel you&rsquo;re sending that way, sir, and say that I would
have sent &rsquo;em before, only I was afraid they might be broken in the
waggon, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t overwhelm the gentleman with ordinary civilities when
you see he&rsquo;s anxious to have something to drink,&rdquo; said the gentleman
with the whiskers, with a jocose air. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ask the
gentleman what he&rsquo;ll take?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me, I quite forgot,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;What <em>will</em> you
take, sir? Will you take port wine, sir, or sherry wine, sir? I
can recommend the ale, sir; or perhaps you&rsquo;d like to taste the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
porter, sir? Allow me to have the felicity of hanging up your
nightcap, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this, the speaker snatched that article of dress from Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s head, and fixed it in a twinkling on that of the drunken
man, who, firmly impressed with the belief that he was delighting
a numerous assembly, continued to hammer away at the comic song
in the most melancholy strains imaginable.</p>

<p>Taking a man&rsquo;s nightcap from his brow by violent means, and
adjusting it on the head of
an unknown gentleman of
dirty exterior, however ingenious
a witticism in itself,
is unquestionably one of
those which come under
the denomination of practical
jokes. Viewing the
matter precisely in this
light, Mr. Pickwick, without
the slightest intimation
of his purpose, sprang vigorously
out of bed, struck
the Zephyr so smart a blow
in the chest as to deprive
him of a considerable portion
of the commodity which
sometimes bears his name,
and then, recapturing his nightcap, boldly placed himself in an
attitude of defence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, gasping no less from excitement than
from the expenditure of so much energy, &ldquo;come on&mdash;both of you&mdash;both
of you!&rdquo; With this liberal invitation the worthy gentleman
communicated a revolving motion to his clenched fists, by
way of appalling his antagonists with a display of science.</p>

<div class="figright"><a id="ill08"></a>
<img src="images/ill08.png" width="259" height="282" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>&ldquo;Come on&mdash;both of you&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>

<p>It might have been Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s very unexpected gallantry, or
it might have been the complicated manner in which he had got
himself out of bed, and fallen all in a mass upon the hornpipe
man, that touched his adversaries. Touched they were; for, instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
of then and there making an attempt to commit manslaughter,
as Mr. Pickwick implicitly believed they would have done,
they paused, stared at each other a short time, and finally laughed
outright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well; you&rsquo;re a trump, and I like you all the better for it,&rdquo;
said the Zephyr. &ldquo;Now jump into bed again, or you&rsquo;ll catch the
rheumatics. No malice, I hope?&rdquo; said the man, extending a hand
the size of the yellow clump of fingers which sometimes swings
over a glover&rsquo;s door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with great alacrity; for
now that the excitement was over, he began to feel rather cool
about the legs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Allow me the <em>h</em>onour,&rdquo; said the gentleman with the whiskers,
presenting his dexter hand, and aspirating the h.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With much pleasure, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick; and having
executed a very long and solemn shake, he got into bed
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Smangle, sir,&rdquo; said the man with the whiskers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mine is Mivins,&rdquo; said the man in the stockings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am delighted to hear it, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hem,&rdquo; coughed Mr. Smangle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you speak, sir?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I did not, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Smangle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you did, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>All this was very genteel and pleasant; and to make matters
still more comfortable, Mr. Smangle assured Mr. Pickwick a great
many times that he entertained a very high respect for the feelings
of a gentleman; which sentiment, indeed, did him infinite credit,
as he could be in no wise supposed to understand them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going through the court, sir?&rdquo; inquired Mr.
Smangle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Through the what?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Through the Court&mdash;Portugal Street&mdash;the Court for the
Relief of&mdash;you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;No, I am not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going out, perhaps?&rdquo; suggested Mivins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear not,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;I refuse to pay some
damages, and am here in consequence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Mr. Smangle, &ldquo;paper has been my ruin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A stationer, I presume, sir?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, innocently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stationer! No, no; confound and curse me! Not so low as
that. No trade. When I say paper, I mean bills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you use the word in that sense. I see,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damme! A gentleman must expect reverses,&rdquo; said Smangle.
&ldquo;What of that? Here am I in the Fleet Prison. Well; good.
What then? I&rsquo;m none the worse for that, am I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; replied Mr. Mivins. And he was quite right; for,
so far from Mr. Smangle being any the worse for it, he was something
the better, inasmuch as to qualify himself for the place, he
had obtained gratuitous possession of certain articles of jewellery,
which, long before that, had found their way to the pawnbroker&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well; but come,&rdquo; said Mr. Smangle; &ldquo;this is dry work.
Let&rsquo;s rinse our mouths with a drop of burnt sherry; the last
comer shall stand it, Mivins shall fetch it, and I&rsquo;ll help to drink
it. That&rsquo;s a fair and gentlemanlike division of labour, anyhow.
Curse me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unwilling to hazard another quarrel, Mr. Pickwick gladly
assented to the proposition, and consigned the money to Mr.
Mivins, who, as it was nearly eleven o&rsquo;clock, lost no time in repairing
to the coffee-room on his errand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; whispered Smangle, the moment his friend had left
the room; &ldquo;what did you give him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Half a sovereign,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a devilish pleasant gentlemanly dog,&rdquo; said Mr. Smangle;&mdash;&ldquo;infernal
pleasant. I don&rsquo;t know anybody more so, but&mdash;&rdquo;
Here Mr. Smangle stopped short, and shook his head dubiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think there is any probability of his appropriating
the money to his own use?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no! Mind, I don&rsquo;t say that; I expressly say that he&rsquo;s a
devilish gentlemanly fellow,&rdquo; said Mr. Smangle. &ldquo;But I think,
perhaps, if somebody went down, just to see that he didn&rsquo;t dip his
beak into the jug by accident, or make some confounded mistake
in losing the money as he came up-stairs, it would be as well.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Here, you sir, just run down-stairs, and look after that gentleman,
will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This request was addressed to a little timid-looking, nervous
man, whose appearance bespoke great poverty, and who had been
crouching on his bedstead all this while, apparently stupefied by
the novelty of his situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know where the coffee-room is,&rdquo; said Smangle; &ldquo;just
run down, and tell that gentleman you&rsquo;ve come to help him up
with the jug. Or&mdash;stop&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell you what&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell you how
we&rsquo;ll do him,&rdquo; said Smangle, with a cunning look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send down word that he&rsquo;s to spend the change in cigars.
Capital thought. Run and tell him that; d&rsquo;ye hear? They
shan&rsquo;t be wasted,&rdquo; continued Smangle, turning to Mr. Pickwick.
&ldquo;<em>I&rsquo;ll</em> smoke &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This man&oelig;uvring was so exceedingly ingenious, and, withal,
performed with such immovable composure and coolness, that Mr.
Pickwick would have had no wish to disturb it, even if he had had
the power. In a short time Mr. Mivins returned, bearing the
sherry, which Mr. Smangle dispensed in two little cracked mugs;
considerately remarking, with reference to himself, that a gentleman
must not be particular under such circumstances, and that,
for his part, he was not too proud to drink out of the jug. In
which, to show his sincerity, he forthwith pledged the company in
a draught which half emptied it.</p>

<p>An excellent understanding having been by these means promoted,
Mr. Smangle proceeded to entertain his hearers with a
relation of divers romantic adventures in which he had been from
time to time engaged, involving various interesting anecdotes of a
thorough-bred horse, and a magnificent Jewess, both of surpassing
beauty, and much coveted by the nobility and gentry of these
kingdoms.</p>

<p>Long before these elegant extracts from the biography of a
gentleman were concluded, Mr. Mivins had betaken himself to bed,
and had set in snoring for the night: leaving the timid stranger
and Mr. Pickwick to the full benefit of Mr. Smangle&rsquo;s experiences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor were the two last-named gentlemen as much edified as they
might have been, by the moving passages narrated. Mr. Pickwick
had been in a state of slumber for some time, when he had a faint
perception of the drunken man bursting out afresh with the comic
song, and receiving from Mr. Smangle a gentle intimation, through
the medium of the water jug, that his audience were not musically
disposed. Mr. Pickwick then once again dropped off to sleep, with
a confused consciousness that Mr. Smangle was still engaged in
relating a long story, the chief point of which appeared to be, that
on some occasion particularly stated and set forth, he had &ldquo;done&rdquo;
a bill and a gentleman at the same time.</p>

</div></div>

<p class="cap pd07"><span class="upper">When</span> Mr. Pickwick opened his eyes next morning,
the first object upon which they rested, was
Samuel Weller, seated upon a small black portmanteau,
intently regarding, apparently in a
condition of profound abstraction, the stately
figure of the dashing Mr. Smangle; while Mr. Smangle himself,
who was already partially dressed, was seated on his bedstead,
occupied in the desperately hopeless attempt of staring Mr. Weller
out of countenance. We say desperately hopeless, because Sam,
with a comprehensive gaze which took in Mr. Smangle&rsquo;s cap, feet,
head, face, legs, and whiskers, all at the same time, continued to
look steadily on, with every demonstration of lively satisfaction,
but with no more regard to Mr. Smangle&rsquo;s personal sentiments
on the subject than he would have displayed had he been inspecting
a wooden statue, or a straw-embowelled Guy Fawkes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well; will you know me again?&rdquo; said Mr. Smangle, with a
frown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d svear to you anyveres, sir,&rdquo; replied Sam, cheerfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be impertinent to a gentleman, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Smangle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not on no account,&rdquo; replied Sam. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll tell me ven he
vakes, I&rsquo;ll be upon the wery best extra-super behaviour!&rdquo; This
observation, having a remote tendency to imply that Mr. Smangle
was no gentleman, kindled his ire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mivins!&rdquo; said Mr. Smangle, with a passionate air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the office?&rdquo; replied that gentleman from his couch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who the devil is this fellow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Gad,&rdquo; said Mr. Mivins, looking lazily out from under the
bed-clothes, &ldquo;I ought to ask <em>you</em> that. Hasn&rsquo;t he any business
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Mr. Smangle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then knock him down-stairs, and tell him not to presume
to get up till I come and kick him,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Mivins: with
this prompt advice that excellent gentleman again betook himself
to slumber.</p>

<p>The conversation exhibiting these unequivocal symptoms of
verging on the personal, Mr. Pickwick deemed it a fit point at
which to interpose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir?&rdquo; rejoined that gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has anything new occurred since last night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; partickler, sir,&rdquo; replied Sam, glancing at Mr. Smangle&rsquo;s
whiskers; &ldquo;the late prewailance of a close and confined atmosphere
has been rayther favourable to the growth of veeds, of an
alarmin&rsquo; and sangvinary natur&rsquo;; but vith that &rsquo;ere exception things
is quiet enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall get up,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &ldquo;give me some clean
things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whatever hostile intentions Mr. Smangle might have entertained,
his thoughts were speedily diverted by the unpacking of the
portmanteau; the contents of which appeared to impress him at
once with a most favourable opinion, not only of Mr. Pickwick,
but of Sam also, who, he took an early opportunity of declaring in a
tone of voice loud enough for that eccentric personage to overhear,
was a regular thorough-bred original, and consequently the very
man after his own heart. As to Mr. Pickwick, the affection he
conceived for him knew no limits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now is there anything I can do for you, my dear sir?&rdquo; said
Smangle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing that I am aware of, I am obliged to you,&rdquo; replied
Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No linen that you want sent to the washerwoman&rsquo;s? I know
a delightful washerwoman outside, that comes for my things twice
a week; and, by Jove!&mdash;how devilish lucky!&mdash;this is the day she
calls. Shall I put any of those little things up with mine? Don&rsquo;t
say anything about the trouble. Confound and curse it! if one
gentleman under a cloud, is not to put himself a little out of the
way to assist another gentleman in the same condition, what&rsquo;s
human nature?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus spake Mr. Smangle, edging himself meanwhile as near as
possible to the portmanteau, and beaming forth looks of the most
fervent and disinterested friendship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing you want to give out for the man to brush,
my dear creature, is there?&rdquo; resumed Smangle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; whatever, my fine feller,&rdquo; rejoined Sam, taking the
reply into his own mouth. &ldquo;P&rsquo;raps if vun of us wos to brush,
without troubling the man, it &rsquo;ud be more agreeable for all parties,
as the schoolmaster said wen the young gentleman objected to
being flogged by the butler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s nothing that I can send in my little box to the
washerwoman&rsquo;s, is there?&rdquo; said Smangle, turning from Sam to
Mr. Pickwick, with an air of some discomfiture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; whatever, sir,&rdquo; retorted Sam; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afeerd the little
box must be chock-full o&rsquo; your own as it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This speech was accompanied with such a very expressive look
at that particular portion of Mr. Smangle&rsquo;s attire, by the appearance
of which the skill of laundresses in getting up gentlemen&rsquo;s
linen is generally tested, that he was fain to turn upon his heel,
and, for the present at any rate, to give up all design on Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s purse and wardrobe. He accordingly retired in dudgeon
to the racket-ground, where he made a light and wholesome breakfast
on a couple of the cigars which had been purchased on the
previous night.</p>

<p>Mr. Mivins, who was no smoker, and whose account for small
articles of chandlery had also reached down to the bottom of the
slate, and been &ldquo;carried over&rdquo; to the other side, remained in bed,
and, in his own words, &ldquo;took it out in sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After breakfasting in a small closet attached to the coffee-room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
which bore the imposing title of the Snuggery; the temporary
inmate of which, in consideration of a small additional charge, had
the unspeakable advantage of overhearing all the conversation in
the coffee-room aforesaid; and after despatching Mr. Weller on
some necessary errands, Mr. Pickwick repaired to the Lodge, to
consult Mr. Roker concerning his future accommodation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Accommodation, eh?&rdquo; said that gentleman, consulting a
large book. &ldquo;Plenty of that, Mr. Pickvick. Your chummage
ticket will be on twenty-seven, in the third.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;my what, did you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your chummage ticket,&rdquo; replied Mr. Roker; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re up to
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Mr. Roker, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s as plain as Salisbury. You&rsquo;ll have
a chummage ticket upon twenty-seven in the third, and them as is
in the room will be your chums.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are there many of them?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick,
dubiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three,&rdquo; replied Mr. Roker.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick coughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of &rsquo;em&rsquo;s a parson,&rdquo; said Mr. Roker, filling up a little piece
of paper as he spoke; &ldquo;another&rsquo;s a butcher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A butcher,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Roker, giving the nib of his pen a
tap on the desk to cure it of a disinclination to mark. &ldquo;What a
thorough-paced goer he used to be sure-ly! You remember Tom
Martin, Neddy?&rdquo; said Roker, appealing to another man in the
lodge, who was paring the mud off his shoes with a five-and-twenty
bladed pocket-knife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> should think so,&rdquo; replied the party addressed, with a strong
emphasis on the personal pronoun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless my dear eyes!&rdquo; said Mr. Roker, shaking his head slowly
from side to side, and gazing abstractedly out of the grated windows
before him, as if he were fondly recalling some peaceful scene of
his early youth; &ldquo;it seems but yesterday that he whopped the coal-heaver
down Fox-under-the-Hill by the wharf there. I think I
can see him now, a coming up the Strand between the two street-keepers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
a little sobered by the bruising, with a patch o&rsquo; winegar
and brown paper over his right eyelid, and that &rsquo;ere lovely bulldog,
as pinned the little boy arterwards, a following at his heels. What
a rum thing Time is, ain&rsquo;t it, Neddy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gentleman to whom these observations were addressed, who
appeared of a taciturn and thoughtful cast, merely echoed the
inquiry; Mr. Roker, shaking off the poetical and gloomy train of
thought into which he had been betrayed, descended to the common
business of life, and resumed his pen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know what the third gentleman is?&rdquo; inquired Mr.
Pickwick, not very much gratified by this description of his future
associates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that Simpson, Neddy?&rdquo; said Mr. Roker, turning to
his companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What Simpson?&rdquo; said Neddy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, him in twenty-seven in the third, that this gentleman&rsquo;s
going to be chummed on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, him!&rdquo; replied Neddy: &ldquo;he&rsquo;s nothing exactly. He was
a horse chaunter: he&rsquo;s a leg now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, so I thought,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Roker, closing the book, and
placing the small piece of paper in Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
the ticket, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very much perplexed by this summary disposition of his person,
Mr. Pickwick walked back into the prison, revolving in his mind
what he had better do. Convinced, however, that before he took
any other steps it would be advisable to see, and hold personal
converse with, the three gentlemen with whom it was proposed to
quarter him, he made the best of his way to the third flight.</p>

<p>After groping about in the gallery for some time, attempting in
the dim light to decipher the numbers on the different doors, he at
length appealed to a potboy, who happened to be pursuing his
morning occupation of gleaning for pewter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which is twenty-seven, my good fellow?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Five doors further on,&rdquo; replied the potboy. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the
likeness of a man being hung, and smoking a pipe the while, chalked
outside the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Guided by this direction, Mr. Pickwick proceeded slowly along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
the gallery until he encountered the &ldquo;portrait of a gentleman,&rdquo;
above described, upon whose countenance he tapped, with the
knuckle of his fore-finger&mdash;gently at first, and then audibly. After
repeating this process several times without effect, he ventured to
open the door and peep in.</p>

<p>There was only one man in the room, and he was leaning out
of window as far as he could without overbalancing himself, endeavouring,
with great perseverance, to spit upon the crown of the
hat of a personal friend on the parade below. As neither speaking,
coughing, sneezing, knocking, nor any other ordinary mode of
attracting attention, made this person aware of the presence of a
visitor, Mr. Pickwick, after some delay, stepped up to the window,
and pulled him gently by the coat-tail. The individual brought in
his head and shoulders, with great swiftness, and surveying Mr.
Pickwick from head to foot, demanded in a surly tone what the&mdash;something
beginning with a capital H&mdash;he wanted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, consulting his ticket, &ldquo;I believe
this is twenty-seven in the third?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; replied the gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come here in consequence of receiving this bit
paper,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hand it over,&rdquo; said the gentleman.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick complied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think Roker might have chummed you somewhere else,&rdquo;
said Mr. Simpson (for it was the leg), after a very discontented
sort of a pause.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick thought so also; but, under all the circumstances,
he considered it a matter of sound policy to be silent.</p>

<p>Mr. Simpson mused for a few moments after this, and then,
thrusting his head out of the window, gave a shrill whistle, and
pronounced some word aloud, several times. What the word was
Mr. Pickwick could not distinguish; but he rather inferred that it
must be some nickname which distinguished Mr. Martin: from the
fact of a great number of gentlemen on the ground below, immediately
proceeding to cry &ldquo;Butcher!&rdquo; in imitation of the tone in
which that useful class of society are wont, diurnally, to make their
presence known at area railings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>Subsequent occurrences confirmed the accuracy of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
impression; for, in a few seconds, a gentleman, prematurely
broad for his years: clothed in a professional blue jean frock, and
top-boots with circular toes: entered the room nearly out of
breath, closely followed by another gentleman in very shabby
black, and a sealskin cap. The latter gentleman, who fastened his
coat all the way up to his chin by means of a pin and a button
alternately, had a very coarse red face, and looked like a drunken
chaplain; which, indeed, he was.</p>

<p>These two gentlemen having by turns perused Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
billet, the one expressed his opinion that it was &ldquo;a rig,&rdquo; and the
other his conviction that it was &ldquo;a go.&rdquo; Having recorded their
feelings in these very intelligible terms, they looked at Mr. Pickwick
and each other in awkward silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an aggravating thing, just as we got the beds so snug,&rdquo;
said the chaplain, looking at three dirty mattresses, each rolled
up in a blanket: which occupied one corner of the room during
the day, and formed a kind of slab, on which were placed an old
cracked basin, ewer, and soap-dish, of common yellow earthenware,
with a blue flower. &ldquo;Very aggravating.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Martin expressed the same opinion in rather stronger
terms: Mr. Simpson, after having let a variety of expletive
adjectives loose upon society without any substantive to accompany
them, tucked up his sleeves, and began to wash the greens
for dinner.</p>

<p>While this was going on, Mr. Pickwick had been eyeing the room,
which was filthily dirty, and smelt intolerably close. There was
no vestige of either carpet, curtain, or blind. There was not even
a closet in it. Unquestionably there were but few things to put
away, if there had been one; but, however few in number, or
small in individual amount, still, remnants of loaves and pieces of
cheese, and damp towels, and scrags of meat, and articles of wearing
apparel, and mutilated crockery, and bellows without nozzles, and
toasting-forks without prongs, <em>do</em> present somewhat of an uncomfortable
appearance when they are scattered about the floor of a
small apartment, which is the common sitting and sleeping room
of three idle men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose this can be managed somehow,&rdquo; said the butcher,
after a pretty long silence. &ldquo;What will you take to go out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;What did
you say? I hardly understand you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will you take to be paid out?&rdquo; said the butcher.
&ldquo;The regular chummage is two-and-six. Will you take three
bob?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;And a bender?&rdquo; suggested the clerical gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t mind that; it&rsquo;s only twopence a-piece more,&rdquo;
said Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you say, now? We&rsquo;ll pay you out for three-and-sixpence
a week. Come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And stand a gallon of beer down,&rdquo; chimed in Mr. Simpson.
&ldquo;There!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And drink it on the spot,&rdquo; said the chaplain. &ldquo;Now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really am so wholly ignorant of the rules of this place,&rdquo;
returned Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;that I do not yet comprehend you.
<em>Can</em> I live anywhere else? I thought I could not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this inquiry Mr. Martin looked, with a countenance of
excessive surprise, at his two friends, and then each gentleman
pointed with his right thumb over his left shoulder. This action,
imperfectly described in words by the very feeble term of &ldquo;over
the left,&rdquo; when performed by any number of ladies or gentlemen who
are accustomed to act in unison, has a very graceful and airy effect;
its expression is one of light and playful sarcasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Can</em> you!&rdquo; repeated Mr. Martin, with a smile of pity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if I knew as little of life as that, I&rsquo;d eat my hat and
swallow the buckle whole,&rdquo; said the clerical gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So would I,&rdquo; added the sporting one, solemnly.</p>

<p>After this introductory preface, the three chums informed Mr.
Pickwick, in a breath, that money was in the Fleet, just what money
was out of it; that it would instantly procure him almost anything
he desired; and that, supposing he had it, and had no objection
to spend it, if he only signified his wish to have a room to himself
he might take possession of one, furnished and fitted to boot, in half
an hour&rsquo;s time.</p>

<p>With this, the parties separated, very much to their common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
satisfaction: Mr. Pickwick once more retracing his steps to the
lodge: and the three companions adjourned to the coffee-room,
there to spend the five shillings which the clerical gentleman had,
with admirable prudence and foresight, borrowed of him for the
purpose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knowed it!&rdquo; said Mr. Roker, with a chuckle, when Mr.
Pickwick stated the object with which he had returned. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t
I say so, Neddy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The philosophical owner of the universal penknife growled an
affirmative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knowed you&rsquo;d want a room for yourself, bless you!&rdquo; said
Mr. Roker. &ldquo;Let me see. You&rsquo;ll want some furniture. You&rsquo;ll
hire that of me, I suppose? That&rsquo;s the reg&rsquo;lar thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With great pleasure,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a capital room up in the coffee-room flight, that
belongs to a Chancery prisoner,&rdquo; said Mr. Roker. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll stand you
in a pound a week. I suppose you don&rsquo;t mind that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just step there with me,&rdquo; said Roker, taking up his hat with
great alacrity; &ldquo;the matter&rsquo;s settled in five minutes. Lord!
why didn&rsquo;t you say at first that you was willing to come down
handsome?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The matter was soon arranged, as the turnkey had foretold.
The Chancery prisoner had been there long enough to have lost
friends, fortune, home, and happiness, and to have acquired the
right of having a room to himself. As he laboured, however, under
the inconvenience of often wanting a morsel of bread, he eagerly
listened to Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s proposal to rent the apartment, and
readily covenanted and agreed to yield him up the sole and undisturbed
possession thereof, in consideration of the weekly payment
of twenty shillings; from which fund he furthermore
contracted to pay out any person or persons that might be
chummed upon it.</p>

<p>As they struck the bargain, Mr. Pickwick surveyed him with a
painful interest. He was a tall, gaunt, cadaverous man, in an old
great-coat and slippers: with sunken cheeks, and a restless, eager
eye. His lips were bloodless, and his bones sharp and thin. God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
help him! the iron teeth of confinement and privation had been
slowly filing him down for twenty years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where will you live meanwhile, sir?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick,
as he laid the amount of the first week&rsquo;s rent, in advance, on the
tottering table.</p>

<p>The man gathered up the money with a trembling hand, and
replied that he didn&rsquo;t know yet; he must go and see where he
could move his bed to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, laying his hand gently and
compassionately on his arm; &ldquo;I am afraid you will have to live in
some noisy crowded place. Now, pray, consider this room your
own when you want quiet, or when any of your friends come to
see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friends!&rdquo; interposed the man, in a voice which rattled in his
throat. &ldquo;If I lay dead at the bottom of the deepest mine in the
world; tight screwed down and soldered in my coffin; rotting in
the dark and filthy ditch that drags its slime along, beneath the
foundations of this prison; I could not be more forgotten or unheeded
than I am here. I am a dead man; dead to society,
without the pity they bestow on those whose souls have passed to
judgment. Friends to see <em>me</em>! My God! I have sunk, from the
prime of life into old age, in this place, and there is not one to
raise his hand above my bed when I lie dead upon it, and say, &lsquo;It
is a blessing he is gone!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The excitement, which had cast an unwonted light over the
man&rsquo;s face while he spoke, subsided as he concluded; and, pressing
his withered hands together in a hasty and disordered manner, he
shuffled from the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rides rather rusty,&rdquo; said Mr. Roker, with a smile. &ldquo;Ah!
they&rsquo;re like the elephants. They feel it now and then, and it makes
&rsquo;em wild!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having made this deeply sympathising remark, Mr. Roker
entered upon his arrangements with such expedition, that in a
short time the room was furnished with a carpet, six chairs, a table,
a sofa bedstead, a tea-kettle, and various small articles, on hire, at
the very reasonable rate of seven-and-twenty shillings and sixpence
per week.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, is there anything more we can do for you?&rdquo; inquired
Mr. Roker, looking round with great satisfaction, and gaily chinking
the first week&rsquo;s hire in his closed fist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, who had been musing deeply
for some time. &ldquo;Are there any people here, who run on errands,
and so forth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Outside, do you mean?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Roker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I mean who are able to go outside. Not prisoners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is,&rdquo; said Roker. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an unfortunate devil,
who has got a friend on the poor side, that&rsquo;s glad to do anything of
that sort. He&rsquo;s been running odd jobs, and that, for the last two
months. Shall I send him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;Stay; no. The poor
side, you say? I should like to see it. I&rsquo;ll go to him myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The poor side of a debtor&rsquo;s prison is, as its name imports, that
in which the most miserable and abject class of debtors are confined.
A prisoner having declared upon the poor side, pays neither
rent nor chummage. His fees, upon entering and leaving the gaol,
are reduced in amount, and he becomes entitled to a share of some
small quantities of food: to provide which, a few charitable persons
have, from time to time, left trifling legacies in their wills. Most
of our readers will remember that, until within a very few years
past, there was a kind of iron cage in the wall of the Fleet Prison,
within which was posted some man of hungry looks, who, from time
to time, rattled a money-box, and exclaimed in a mournful voice,
&ldquo;Pray, remember the poor debtors; pray, remember the poor
debtors.&rdquo; The receipts of this box, when there were any, were
divided among the poor prisoners; and the men on the poor side
relieved each other in this degrading office.</p>

<p>Although this custom has been abolished, and the cage is now
boarded up, the miserable and destitute condition of these unhappy
persons remains the same. We no longer suffer them to appeal at
the prison gates to the charity and compassion of the passers-by;
but we still leave unblotted in the leaves of our statute book, for
the reverence and admiration of succeeding ages, that just and
wholesome law which declares that the sturdy felon shall be fed
and clothed, and that the penniless debtor shall be left to die of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
starvation and nakedness. This is no fiction. Not a week passes
over our heads, but, in every one of our prisons for debt, some of
these men must inevitably expire in the slow agonies of want, if
they were not relieved by their fellow-prisoners.</p>

<p>Turning these things in his mind, as he mounted the narrow
staircase at the foot of which Roker had left him, Mr. Pickwick
gradually worked himself to the boiling-over point; and so excited
was he with his reflections on this subject, that he had burst into
the room to which he had been directed, before he had any distinct
recollection, either of the place in which he was, or of the object
of his visit.</p>

<p>The general aspect of the room recalled him to himself at
once; but he had no sooner cast his eyes on the figure of a man
who was brooding over the dusty fire, than, letting his hat fall on the
floor, he stood perfectly fixed, and immovable, with astonishment.</p>

<p>Yes; in tattered garments, and without a coat; his common
calico shirt yellow and in rags; his hair hanging over his face; his
features changed with suffering, and pinched with famine; there sat
Mr. Alfred Jingle: his head resting on his hand, his eyes fixed upon
the fire, and his whole appearance denoting misery and dejection!</p>

<p>Near him, leaning listlessly against the wall, stood a strong-built
countryman, flicking with a worn-out hunting-whip the top-boot
that adorned his right foot: his left being (for he dressed by easy
stages) thrust into an old slipper. Horses, dogs, and drink, had
brought him there pell-mell. There was a rusty spur on the solitary
boot, which he occasionally jerked into the empty air, at the same
time giving the boot a smart blow, and muttering some of the
sounds by which a sportsman encourages his horse. He was riding,
in imagination, some desperate steeplechase at that moment. Poor
wretch! He never rode a match on the swiftest animal in his
costly stud, with half the speed at which he had torn along the
course that ended in the Fleet.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the room an old man was seated on a
small wooden box, with his eyes riveted on the floor, and his face
settled into an expression of the deepest and most hopeless despair.
A young girl&mdash;his little granddaughter&mdash;was hanging about him:
endeavouring, with a thousand childish devices, to engage his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
attention; but the old man neither saw nor heard her. The voice
that had been music to him, and the eyes that had been light, fell
coldly on his senses. His limbs were shaking with disease, and the
palsy had fastened on his mind.</p>

<p>There were two or three other men in the room, congregated in
a little knot, and noisily talking among themselves. There was a
lean and haggard woman, too&mdash;a prisoner&rsquo;s wife&mdash;who was watering,
with great solicitude, the wretched stump of a dried-up,
withered plant, which, it was plain to see, could never send forth
a green leaf again: too true an emblem, perhaps, of the office she
had come there to discharge.</p>

<p>Such were the objects which presented themselves to Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
view, as he looked round him in amazement. The noise of
some one stumbling hastily into the room, roused him. Turning
his eyes towards the door, they encountered the new comer; and
in him, through his rags and dirt, he recognised the familiar features
of Mr. Job Trotter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pickwick!&rdquo; exclaimed Job aloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; said Jingle, starting from his seat. &ldquo;Mr.&mdash;&mdash;! So it
is&mdash;queer place&mdash;strange thing&mdash;serves me right&mdash;very.&rdquo; Mr.
Jingle thrust his hands into the place where his trousers pockets
used to be, and, dropping his chin upon his breast, sank back
into his chair.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick was affected; the two men looked so very miserable.
The sharp involuntary glance Jingle had cast at a small
piece of raw loin of mutton, which Job had brought in with him,
said more of their reduced state than two hours&rsquo; explanation could
have done. Mr. Pickwick looked mildly at Jingle, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to speak to you in private. Will you step out
for an instant?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Jingle, rising hastily. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t step far&mdash;no
danger of over-walking yourself here&mdash;Spike park&mdash;grounds pretty&mdash;romantic,
but not extensive&mdash;open for public inspection&mdash;family
always in town&mdash;housekeeper desperately careful&mdash;very.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have forgotten your coat,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, as they
walked out to the staircase, and closed the door after them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; said Jingle. &ldquo;Spout&mdash;dear relation&mdash;Uncle Tom&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
help it&mdash;must eat, you know. Wants of nature&mdash;and
all that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone, my dear sir&mdash;last coat&mdash;can&rsquo;t help it. Lived on a pair
of boots&mdash;whole fortnight. Silk umbrella&mdash;ivory handle&mdash;week&mdash;fact&mdash;honour&mdash;ask
Job&mdash;knows it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lived for three weeks upon a pair of boots, and a silk umbrella
with an ivory handle!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, who had only
heard of such things in shipwrecks, or read of them in <cite>Constable&rsquo;s
Miscellany</cite>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Jingle, nodding his head. &ldquo;Pawnbroker&rsquo;s shop&mdash;duplicates
here&mdash;small sums&mdash;mere nothing&mdash;all rascals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, much relieved by this explanation;
&ldquo;I understand you. You have pawned your wardrobe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything&mdash;Job&rsquo;s too&mdash;all shirts gone&mdash;never mind&mdash;saves
washing. Nothing soon&mdash;lie in bed&mdash;starve&mdash;die&mdash;Inquest&mdash;little
bone-house&mdash;poor prisoner&mdash;common necessaries&mdash;hush it up&mdash;gentlemen
of the jury&mdash;warden&rsquo;s tradesmen&mdash;keep it snug&mdash;natural
death&mdash;coroner&rsquo;s order&mdash;workhouse funeral&mdash;serve him right&mdash;all
over&mdash;drop the curtain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jingle delivered this singular summary of his prospects in life,
with his accustomed volubility, and with various twitches of the
countenance to counterfeit smiles. Mr. Pickwick easily perceived
that his recklessness was assumed, and looking him full, but not
unkindly in the face, saw that his eyes were moist with tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good fellow,&rdquo; said Jingle, pressing his hand, and turning his
head away. &ldquo;Ungrateful dog&mdash;boyish to cry&mdash;can&rsquo;t help it&mdash;bad
fever&mdash;weak&mdash;ill&mdash;hungry. Deserved it all&mdash;but suffered much&mdash;very.&rdquo;
Wholly unable to keep up appearances any longer, and
perhaps rendered worse by the effort he had made, the dejected
stroller sat down on the stairs, and, covering his face with his
hands, sobbed like a child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with considerable emotion,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll see what can be done, when I know all about the matter.
Here, Job; where is that fellow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, sir,&rdquo; replied Job, presenting himself on the staircase.
We have described him, by-the-bye, as having deeply sunken eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
in the best of times. In his present state of want and distress, he
looked as if those features had gone out of town altogether.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, sir,&rdquo; cried Job.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come here, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, trying to look stern, with
four large tears running down his waistcoat. &ldquo;Take that, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Take what? In the ordinary acceptation of such language, it
should have been a blow. As the world runs, it ought to have
been a sound, hearty cuff; for Mr. Pickwick had been duped, deceived,
and wronged by the destitute outcast who was now wholly
in his power. Must we tell the truth? It was something from
Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s waistcoat-pocket, which chinked as it was given
into Job&rsquo;s hand, and the giving of which, somehow or other, imparted
a sparkle to the eye, and a swelling to the heart, of our
excellent old friend, as he hurried away.</p>

<p>Sam had returned when Mr. Pickwick reached his own room,
and was inspecting the arrangements that had been made for his
comfort, with a kind of grim satisfaction which was very pleasant
to look upon. Having a decided objection to his master&rsquo;s being
there at all, Mr. Weller appeared to consider it a high moral duty
not to appear too much pleased with anything that was done, said,
suggested, or proposed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Sam?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir?&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty comfortable now, eh, Sam?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty vell, sir,&rdquo; responded Sam, looking round him in a
disparaging manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you seen Mr. Tupman and our other friends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I <em>have</em> seen &rsquo;em, sir, and they&rsquo;re a comin&rsquo; to-morrow, and
wos wery much surprised to hear they warn&rsquo;t to come to-day,&rdquo;
replied Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have brought the things I wanted?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Weller in reply pointed to various packages which he had
arranged, as neatly as he could, in a corner of the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, after a little hesitation;
&ldquo;listen to what I am going to say, Sam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cert&rsquo;nly, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Weller, &ldquo;fire away, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have felt from the first, Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
much solemnity, &ldquo;that this is not the place to bring a young
man to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor an old &rsquo;un, neither, sir,&rdquo; observed Mr. Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite right, Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &ldquo;but old men
may come here, through their own heedlessness and unsuspicion; and
young men may be brought here by the selfishness of those they
serve. It is better for those young men, in every point of view,
that they should not remain here. Do you understand me, Sam?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vy no, sir, I do <span class="lowcap">NOT</span>,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller, doggedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try, Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vell, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Sam, after a short pause, &ldquo;I think I see
your drift; and if I do see your drift, it&rsquo;s my &rsquo;pinion that you&rsquo;re a
comin&rsquo; it a great deal too strong, as the mail coachman said to the
snow-storm, ven it overtook him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you comprehend me, Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;Independently
of my wish that you should not be idling about a place
like this for years to come, I feel that for a debtor in the Fleet to
be attended by his man-servant is a monstrous absurdity. Sam,&rdquo;
said Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;for a time, you must leave me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, for a time, eh, sir?&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Weller, rather sarcastically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, for the time that I remain here,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.
&ldquo;Your wages I shall continue to pay. Any one of my three
friends will be happy to take you, were it only out of respect to
me. And if I ever do leave this place, Sam,&rdquo; added Mr. Pickwick,
with assumed cheerfulness: &ldquo;if I do, I pledge you my word
that you shall return to me instantly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll tell you wot it is, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, in a grave
and solemn voice, &ldquo;this here sort o&rsquo; thing won&rsquo;t do at all, so
don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s hear no more about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am serious and resolved, Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You air, air you, sir?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Weller, firmly. &ldquo;Wery
good, sir. Then so am I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus speaking, Mr. Weller fixed his hat on his head with great
precision, and abruptly left the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sam!&rdquo; cried Mr. Pickwick, calling after him, &ldquo;Sam! Here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the long gallery ceased to re-echo the sound of footsteps.
Sam Weller was gone.</p>

<p class="cap pd20"><span class="upper">In</span> a lofty room, ill-lighted and
worse ventilated, situated in Portugal
Street, Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn
Fields, there sit nearly the
whole year round, one, two,
three, or four gentlemen in
wigs, as the case may be, with
little writing-desks before them, constructed after the fashion of
those used by the judges of the land, barring the French polish.
There is a box of barristers on their right hand; there is an
enclosure of insolvent debtors on their left; and there is an inclined
plane of most especially dirty faces in their front. These gentlemen
are the Commissioners of the Insolvent Court, and the place in
which they sit is the Insolvent Court itself.</p>

<p>It is, and has been, time out of mind, the remarkable fate of
this Court to be, somehow or other, held and understood by the
general consent of all the destitute shabby-genteel people in
London, as their common resort and place of refuge daily. It
is always full. The steams of beer and spirits perpetually ascend
to the ceiling, and, being condensed by the heat, roll down the
walls like rain; there are more old suits of clothes in it at one time
than will be offered for sale in all Houndsditch in a twelvemonth;
more unwashed skins and grizzly beards than all the pumps and
shaving-shops between Tyburn and Whitechapel could render
decent, between sunrise and sunset.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that any of these people have the
least shadow of business in, or the remotest connection with, the
place they so indefatigably attend. If they had, it would be no
matter of surprise, and the singularity of the thing would cease.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
Some of them sleep during the greater part of the sitting; others
carry small portable dinners wrapped in pocket-handkerchiefs, or
sticking out of their worn-out pockets, and munch and listen with
equal relish; but no one among them was ever known to have the
slightest personal interest in any case that was ever brought
forward. Whatever they do, there they sit from the first moment
to the last. When it is heavy rainy weather, they all come in, wet
through; and at such times the vapours of the Court are like
those of a fungus-pit.</p>

<p>A casual visitor might suppose this place to be a Temple dedicated
to the Genius of Seediness. There is not a messenger or
process-server attached to it, who wears a coat that was made for
him; not a tolerably fresh or wholesome-looking man in the
whole establishment, except a little white-headed, apple-faced
tipstaff, and even he, like an ill-conditioned cherry preserved in
brandy, seems to have artificially dried and withered up into a
state of preservation to which he can lay no natural claim. The
very barristers&rsquo; wigs are ill-powdered, and their curls lack crispness.</p>

<p>But the attorneys, who sit at a large bare table below the
Commissioners, are, after all, the greatest curiosities. The professional
establishment of the more opulent of these gentlemen,
consists of a blue bag and a boy; generally a youth of the Jewish
persuasion. They have no fixed offices, their legal business being
transacted in the parlours of public-houses, or the yards of prisons:
whither they repair in crowds, and canvass for customers after
the manner of omnibus cads. They are of a greasy and mildewed
appearance; and if they can be said to have any vices at all,
perhaps drinking and cheating are the most conspicuous among
them. Their residences are usually on the outskirts of &ldquo;the Rules,&rdquo;
chiefly lying within a circle of one mile from the obelisk in St.
George&rsquo;s Fields. Their looks are not prepossessing, and their
manners are peculiar.</p>

<p>Mr. Solomon Pell, one of this learned body, was a fat, flabby,
pale man, in a surtout which looked green one minute and brown
the next: with a velvet collar of the same chameleon tints. His
forehead was narrow, his face wide, his head large, and his nose all
on one side, as if Nature, indignant with the propensities she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
observed in him at his birth, had given it an angry tweak which it
had never recovered. Being short-necked and asthmatic, however,
he respired principally through this feature; so, perhaps, what it
wanted in ornament, it made up in usefulness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure to bring him through it,&rdquo; said Mr. Pell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you though?&rdquo; replied the person to whom the assurance
was pledged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certain sure,&rdquo; replied Pell; &ldquo;but if he&rsquo;d gone to any irregular
practitioner, mind you, I wouldn&rsquo;t have answered for the consequences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the other, with open mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that I wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mr. Pell; and he pursed up his lips,
frowned, and shook his head mysteriously.</p>

<p>Now, the place where this discourse occurred, was the public-house
just opposite to the Insolvent Court: and the person with
whom it was held, was no other than the elder Mr. Weller, who
had come there to comfort and console a friend, whose petition to
be discharged under the Act was to be that day heard, and whose
attorney he was at that moment consulting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And vere is George?&rdquo; inquired the old gentleman.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell jerked his head in the direction of a back parlour:
whither Mr. Weller at once repairing, was immediately greeted in
the warmest and most flattering manner by some half-dozen of his
professional brethren, in token of their gratification at his arrival.
The insolvent gentleman, who had contracted a speculative but
imprudent passion for horsing long stages, which had led to his
present embarrassments, looked extremely well, and was soothing
the excitement of his feelings with shrimps and porter.</p>

<p>The salutation between Mr. Weller and his friends was strictly
confined to the freemasonry of the craft; consisting of a jerking
round of the right wrist, and a tossing of the little finger into the
air at the same time. We once knew two famous coachmen (they
are dead now, poor fellows) who were twins, and between whom an
unaffected and devoted attachment existed. They passed each
other on the Dover road, every day, for twenty-four years, never
exchanging any other greeting than this; and yet, when one died,
the other pined away, and soon afterwards followed him!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Vell, George,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller senior, taking off his upper
coat, and seating himself with his accustomed gravity, &ldquo;how is it?
All right behind, and full inside?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, old feller,&rdquo; replied the embarrassed gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the grey mare made over to anybody?&rdquo; inquired Mr.
Weller, anxiously.</p>

<p>George nodded in the affirmative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vell, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller. &ldquo;Coach taken care
on also?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Con-signed in a safe quarter,&rdquo; replied George, wringing the
heads off half a dozen shrimps, and swallowing them without any
more ado.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wery good, wery good,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller. &ldquo;Alvays see to the
drag ven you go down hill. Is the vay-bill all clear and straight
for&rsquo;erd?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The schedule, sir,&rdquo; said Pell, guessing at Mr. Weller&rsquo;s meaning,
&ldquo;the schedule is as plain and satisfactory as pen and ink can
make it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Weller nodded in a manner which bespoke his inward
approval of these arrangements; and then, turning to Mr. Pell,
said, pointing to his friend George:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ven do you take his cloths off?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pell, &ldquo;he stands third on the opposed list,
and I should think it would be his turn in about half an hour. I
told my clerk to come over and tell us when there was a chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Weller surveyed the attorney from head to foot with great
admiration, and said emphatically:</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;ll you take, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, really,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pell, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re very&mdash;. Upon my
word and honour, I&rsquo;m not in the habit of&mdash;. It&rsquo;s so very early
in the morning, that, actually, I am almost&mdash;. Well, you may
bring me three penn&rsquo;orth of rum, my dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The officiating damsel, who had anticipated the order before it
was given, set the glass of spirits before Pell, and retired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Mr. Pell, looking round upon the company,
&ldquo;success to your friend! I don&rsquo;t like to boast, gentlemen; it&rsquo;s not
my way; but I can&rsquo;t help saying, that, if your friend hadn&rsquo;t been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
fortunate enough to fall into the hands that&mdash;but I won&rsquo;t say
what I was going to say. Gentlemen, my service to you.&rdquo; Having
emptied the glass in a twinkling, Mr. Pell smacked his lips, and
looked complacently round on the assembled coachmen, who
evidently regarded him as a species of divinity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said the legal authority. &ldquo;What was I a saying,
gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you was remarkin&rsquo; as you wouldn&rsquo;t have no objection
to another o&rsquo; the same, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, with grave
facetiousness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha ha!&rdquo; laughed Mr. Pell. &ldquo;Not bad, not bad. A professional
man, too! At this time of the morning, it would be
rather too good a&mdash;. Well, I don&rsquo;t know, my dear&mdash;you <em>may</em>
do that again, if you please. Hem!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This last sound was a solemn and dignified cough, in which
Mr. Pell, observing an indecent tendency to mirth in some of his
auditors, considered it due to himself to indulge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The late Lord Chancellor, gentlemen, was very fond of me,&rdquo;
said Mr. Pell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And wery creditable in him, too,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear, hear,&rdquo; assented Mr. Pell&rsquo;s client. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t
he be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! Why, indeed!&rdquo; said a very red-faced man, who had said
nothing yet, and who looked extremely unlikely to say anything
more. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A murmur of assent ran through the company.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Pell, &ldquo;dining with him on one
occasion;&mdash;there was only us two, but everything as splendid as if
twenty people had been expected&mdash;the great seal on a dumb-waiter
at his right hand, and a man in a bag-wig and suit of armour
guarding the mace with a drawn sword and silk stockings&mdash;which
is perpetually done, gentlemen, night and day, when he said,
&lsquo;Pell,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;no false delicacy, Pell. You&rsquo;re a man of talent;
you can get anybody through the Insolvent Court, Pell; and your
country should be proud of you.&rsquo; Those were his very words.
&lsquo;My Lord,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;you flatter me.&rsquo; &lsquo;Pell,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;if I do,
I&rsquo;m damned.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he say that?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did,&rdquo; replied Pell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vell, then,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, &ldquo;I say Parliament ought to
ha&rsquo; took it up; and if he&rsquo;d been a poor man, they <em>would</em> ha&rsquo;
done it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear friend,&rdquo; argued Mr. Pell, &ldquo;it was in confidence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In what?&rdquo; said Mr. Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In confidence,&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! wery good,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller, after a little reflection.
&ldquo;If he damned his-self in confidence, o&rsquo; course that was another
thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it was,&rdquo; said Mr. Pell. &ldquo;The distinction&rsquo;s obvious,
you will perceive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alters the case entirely,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller. &ldquo;Go on, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I will not go on, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Pell, in a low and serious
tone. &ldquo;You have reminded me, sir, that this conversation was
private&mdash;private and confidential, gentlemen. Gentlemen, I am a
professional man. It may be that I am a good deal looked up to
in my profession&mdash;it may be that I am not. Most people know.
I say nothing. Observations have already been made, in this
room, injurious to the reputation of my noble friend. You will
excuse me, gentlemen; I was imprudent. I feel that I have no
right to mention this matter without his concurrence. Thank you,
sir, thank you.&rdquo; Thus delivering himself, Mr. Pell thrust his hands
into his pockets, and, frowning grimly around, rattled three halfpence
with terrible determination.</p>

<p>This virtuous resolution had scarcely been formed, when the boy
and the blue bag, who were inseparable companions, rushed
violently into the room, and said (at least the boy did, for the
blue bag took no part in the announcement) that the case was
coming on directly. The intelligence was no sooner received
than the whole party hurried across the street, and began to fight
their way into Court&mdash;a preparatory ceremony, which has been
calculated to occupy, in ordinary cases, from twenty-five minutes
to thirty.</p>

<p>Mr. Weller, being stout, cast himself at once into the crowd, with
the desperate hope of ultimately turning up in some place which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
would suit him. His success was not quite equal to his expectations;
for having neglected to take his hat off, it was knocked
over his eyes by some unseen person, upon whose toes he had
alighted with considerable force. Apparently, this individual
regretted his impetuosity immediately afterwards; for, muttering
an indistinct exclamation of surprise, he dragged the old man out
into the hall, and, after a violent struggle, released his head and
face.</p>

<p>After a violent struggle, released his head and face</p>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Samivel!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Weller, when he was thus enabled
to behold his rescuer.</p>

<p>Sam nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dutiful and affectionate little boy, you are, ain&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, &ldquo;to come a bonnetin&rsquo; your father in his
old age?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How should I know who you wos?&rdquo; responded the son.
&ldquo;Do you s&rsquo;pose I wos to tell you by the weight o&rsquo; your foot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vell, that&rsquo;s wery true, Sammy,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller, mollified
at once; &ldquo;but wot are you a doin&rsquo; on here? Your gov&rsquo;ner can&rsquo;t
do no good here, Sammy. They won&rsquo;t pass that werdick, they
won&rsquo;t pass it, Sammy.&rdquo; And Mr. Weller shook his head, with
legal solemnity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot a perwerse old file it is!&rdquo; exclaimed Sam, &ldquo;alvays a
goin&rsquo; on about werdicks and alleybis, and that. Who said anything
about the werdick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Weller made no reply, but once more shook his head
most learnedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave off rattlin&rsquo; that &rsquo;ere nob o&rsquo; yourn, if you don&rsquo;t want
it to come off the springs altogether,&rdquo; said Sam, impatiently,
&ldquo;and behave reasonable. I vent all the vay down to the Markis
o&rsquo; Granby, arter you, last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see the Marchioness o&rsquo; Granby, Sammy?&rdquo; inquired
Mr. Weller, with a sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did,&rdquo; replied Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How wos the dear creetur a lookin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wery queer,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s a injurin&rsquo; herself
gradivally vith too much o&rsquo; that &rsquo;ere pine-apple rum, and other
strong medicines o&rsquo; the same natur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that, Sammy?&rdquo; said the senior, earnestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do, indeed,&rdquo; replied the junior. Mr. Weller seized his son&rsquo;s
hand, clasped it, and let it fall. There was an expression on his
countenance in doing so&mdash;not of dismay or apprehension, but
partaking more of the sweet and gentle character of hope. A
gleam of resignation, and even of cheerfulness, passed over his face
too, as he slowly said, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t quite certain, Sammy; I wouldn&rsquo;t
like to say I wos altogether positive, in case of any subsekent disappintment,
but I rayther think, my boy, I rayther think, that
the shepherd&rsquo;s got the liver complaint!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does he look bad?&rdquo; inquired Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s uncommon pale,&rdquo; replied his father, &ldquo;&rsquo;cept about the
nose, which is redder than ever. His appetite is wery so-so, but he
imbibes wunderful.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>Some thoughts of the rum appeared to obtrude themselves on
Mr. Weller&rsquo;s mind, as he said this; for he looked gloomy and
thoughtful; but he very shortly recovered, as was testified by a
perfect alphabet of winks, in which he was only wont to indulge
when particularly pleased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vell now,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;about my affair. Just open them ears
o&rsquo; yourn, and don&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo; till I&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo; With this brief
preface, Sam related, as succinctly as he could, the last memorable
conversation he had had with Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop there by himself, poor creetur!&rdquo; exclaimed the elder
Mr. Weller, &ldquo;without nobody to take his part! It can&rsquo;t be done,
Samivel, it can&rsquo;t be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O&rsquo; course it can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; asserted Sam; &ldquo;I know&rsquo;d that, afore I
came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wy, they&rsquo;ll eat him up alive, Sammy,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Weller.
Sam nodded his concurrence in the opinion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He goes in rayther raw, Sammy,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, metaphorically,
&ldquo;and he&rsquo;ll come out, done so ex-ceedin&rsquo; brown, that his most
familiar friends won&rsquo;t know him. Roast pigeon&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; to it,
Sammy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Sam Weller nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It oughtn&rsquo;t to be, Samivel,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It mustn&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cert&rsquo;nly not,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vell now,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve been a prophesyin&rsquo; away,
wery fine, like a red-faced Nixon as the sixpenny books gives picters
on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who wos he, Sammy?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind who he was,&rdquo; retorted Sam; &ldquo;he warn&rsquo;t a coachman;
that&rsquo;s enough for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know&rsquo;d a ostler o&rsquo; that name,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, musing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It warn&rsquo;t him,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;This here gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n was a
prophet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s a prophet?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Weller, looking sternly on
his son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wy, a man as tells what&rsquo;s a goin&rsquo; to happen,&rdquo; replied Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d know&rsquo;d him, Sammy,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller. &ldquo;P&rsquo;raps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
he might ha&rsquo; throw&rsquo;d a small light on that &rsquo;ere liver complaint as we
wos a speakin&rsquo; on, just now. Hows&rsquo;ever, if he&rsquo;s dead, and ain&rsquo;t left
the bisness to nobody, there&rsquo;s an end on it. Go on, Sammy,&rdquo; said
Mr. Weller, with a sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve been a prophesyin&rsquo; avay, about
wot&rsquo;ll happen to the gov&rsquo;nor if he&rsquo;s left alone. Don&rsquo;t you see any
vay o&rsquo; takin&rsquo; care on him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t, Sammy,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, with a reflective
visage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No vay at all?&rdquo; inquired Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No vay,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, &ldquo;unless&rdquo;&mdash;and a gleam of intelligence
lighted up his countenance as he sunk his voice to a whisper,
and applied his mouth to the ear of his offspring&mdash;&ldquo;unless it is
getting him out in a turn-up bedstead, unbeknown to the turnkeys,
Sammy, or dressin&rsquo; him up like a old &rsquo;ooman vith a green
wail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam Weller received both of these suggestions with unexpected
contempt, and again propounded his question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the old gentleman; &ldquo;if he von&rsquo;t let you stop
there I see no vay at all. It&rsquo;s no thoroughfare, Sammy, no
thoroughfare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I&rsquo;ll tell you wot it is,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll trouble you
for the loan of five-and-twenty pound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What good &rsquo;ull that do?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; replied Sam. &ldquo;P&rsquo;raps you may ask for it, five
minits artervards; p&rsquo;raps I may say I von&rsquo;t pay, and cut up
rough. You von&rsquo;t think o&rsquo; arrestin&rsquo; your own son for the
money, and sendin&rsquo; him off to the Fleet, will you, you unnat&rsquo;ral
wagabone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this reply of Sam&rsquo;s the father and son exchanged a complete
code of telegraphic nods and gestures, after which, the elder Mr.
Weller sat himself down on a stone step, and laughed till he was
purple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot a old image it is!&rdquo; exclaimed Sam, indignant at this loss
of time. &ldquo;What are you a settin&rsquo; down there for, conwertin&rsquo; your
face into a street-door knocker, ven there&rsquo;s so much to be done?
Where&rsquo;s the money?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In the boot, Sammy, in the boot,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller, composing
his features. &ldquo;Hold my hat, Sammy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having divested himself of this incumbrance, Mr. Weller gave
his body a sudden wrench to one side, and, by a dexterous twist,
contrived to get his right hand into a most capacious pocket, from
whence, after a great deal of panting and exertion, he extricated a
pocket-book of the large octavo size, fastened by a huge leathern
strap. From this ledger he drew forth a couple of whip-lashes,
three or four buckles, a little sample-bag of corn, and finally a
small roll of very dirty bank-notes: from which he selected the
required amount, which he handed over to Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, Sammy,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, when the whip-lashes
and the buckles, and the samples, had been all put back,
and the book once more deposited at the bottom of the same
pocket, &ldquo;now, Sammy, I know a gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n here, as&rsquo;ll do the rest
o&rsquo; the bisness for us, in no time&mdash;a limb o&rsquo; the law, Sammy, as has
got brains like the frogs, dispersed all over his body, and reachin&rsquo; to
the wery tips of his fingers; a friend of the Lord Chancellorship&rsquo;s,
Sammy, who&rsquo;d only have to tell him what he wanted, and he&rsquo;d lock
you up for life, if that wos all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;none o&rsquo; that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None o&rsquo; wot?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wy, none o&rsquo; them unconstitootional ways o&rsquo; doing it,&rdquo; retorted
Sam. &ldquo;The have-his-carcase, next to the perpetual motion,
is vun of the blessedest things as wos ever made. I&rsquo;ve read that
&rsquo;ere in the newspapers, wery of&rsquo;en.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, wot&rsquo;s that got to do vith it?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just this here,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;ll patronise the inwention,
and go in, that vay. No visperin&rsquo;s to the Chancellorship, I don&rsquo;t
like the notion. It mayn&rsquo;t be altogether safe, vith reference to
gettin&rsquo; out agin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Deferring to his son&rsquo;s feeling upon this point, Mr. Weller at
once sought the erudite Solomon Pell, and acquainted him with his
desire to issue a writ, instantly, for the sum of twenty-five pounds,
and costs of process; to be executed without delay upon the body
of one Samuel Weller; the charges thereby incurred to be paid in
advance to Solomon Pell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>The attorney was in high glee, for the embarrassed coach-horser
was ordered to be discharged forthwith. He highly approved of
Sam&rsquo;s attachment to his master; declared that it strongly reminded
him of his own feelings of devotion to his friend the Chancellor;
and at once led the elder Mr. Weller down to the Temple, to swear
the affidavit of debt, which the boy, with the assistance of the blue
bag, had drawn up on the spot.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sam, having been formally introduced to the white-washed
gentleman and his friends, as the offspring of Mr. Weller,
of the Belle Savage, was treated with marked distinction, and
invited to regale himself with them in honour of the occasion; an
invitation which he was by no means backward in accepting.</p>

<p>The mirth of gentlemen of this class is of a grave and quiet
character, usually; but the present instance was one of peculiar
festivity, and they relaxed in proportion. After some rather
tumultuous toasting of the Chief Commissioner and Mr. Solomon
Pell, who had that day displayed such transcendent abilities, a
mottled-faced gentleman in a blue shawl proposed that somebody
should sing a song. The obvious suggestion was, that the mottled-faced
gentleman, being anxious for a song, should sing it himself;
but this the mottled-faced gentleman sturdily, and somewhat
offensively, declined to do. Upon which, as is not unusual in such
cases, a rather angry colloquy ensued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said the coach-horser, &ldquo;rather than disturb the
harmony of this delightful occasion, perhaps Mr. Samuel Weller
will oblige the company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Raly, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not wery much in the habit
o&rsquo; singin&rsquo; without the instrument: but anythin&rsquo; for a quiet
life, as the man said when he took the sitivation at the light-house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this prelude, Mr. Samuel Weller burst at once into the
following wild and beautiful legend, which, under the impression
that it is not generally known, we take the liberty of quoting.
We would beg to call particular attention to the monosyllable at
the end of the second and fourth lines, which not only enables
the singer to take breath at those points, but greatly assists the
metre.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I maintain that that &rsquo;ere song&rsquo;s personal to the cloth,&rdquo; said
the mottled-faced gentleman, interrupting it at this point. &ldquo;I
demand the name o&rsquo; that coachman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody know&rsquo;d,&rdquo; replied Sam. &ldquo;He hadn&rsquo;t got his card in
his pocket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I object to the introduction o&rsquo; politics,&rdquo; said the mottled-faced
gentleman. &ldquo;I submit that, in the present company, that &rsquo;ere
song&rsquo;s political; and, wot&rsquo;s much the same, that it ain&rsquo;t true. I
say that that coachman did <em>not</em> run away; but that he died
game&mdash;game as pheasants; and I won&rsquo;t hear nothin&rsquo; said to the
contrairey.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>As the mottled-faced gentleman spoke with great energy and
determination: and as the opinions of the company seemed
divided on the subject: it threatened to give rise to fresh altercation,
when Mr. Weller and Mr. Pell most opportunely arrived.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Sammy,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The officer will be here at four o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said Mr. Pell. &ldquo;I
suppose you won&rsquo;t run away meanwhile, eh? Ha! ha!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;raps my cruel pa &rsquo;ull relent afore then,&rdquo; replied Sam, with a
broad grin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; said the elder Mr. Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do,&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not on no account,&rdquo; replied the inexorable creditor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give bills for the amount, at sixpence a month,&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t take &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha, ha! very good, very good,&rdquo; said Mr. Solomon Pell,
who was making out his little bill of costs; &ldquo;a very amusing
incident indeed! Benjamin, copy that.&rdquo; And Mr. Pell smiled
again, as he called Mr. Weller&rsquo;s attention to the amount.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, thank you,&rdquo; said the professional gentleman,
taking up another of the greasy notes as Mr. Weller took it from
the pocket-book. &ldquo;Three ten and one ten is five. Much obliged to
you, Mr. Weller. Your son is a most deserving young man, very
much so indeed, sir. It&rsquo;s a very pleasant trait in a young man&rsquo;s
character, very much so,&rdquo; added Mr. Pell, smiling smoothly round,
as he buttoned up the money.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot a game it is!&rdquo; said the elder Mr. Weller, with a chuckle.
&ldquo;A reg&rsquo;lar prodigy son!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prodigal, prodigal son, sir,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Pell, mildly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, with dignity. &ldquo;I know
wot&rsquo;s o&rsquo;clock, sir. Ven I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll ask you, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the time the officer arrived, Sam had made himself so
extremely popular, that the congregated gentlemen determined to
see him to prison in a body. So, off they set; the plaintiff and
defendant walking arm-in-arm; the officer in front; and eight
stout coachmen bringing up the rear. At Serjeant&rsquo;s Inn Coffee-house
the whole party halted to refresh, and, the legal arrangements
being completed, the procession moved on again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>Some little commotion was occasioned in Fleet Street, by the
pleasantry of the eight gentlemen in the flank, who persevered
in walking four abreast; it was also found necessary to leave the
mottled-faced gentleman behind, to fight a ticket-porter, it being
arranged that his friends should call for him as they came back.
Nothing but these little incidents occurred on the way. When
they reached the gate of the Fleet, the cavalcade, taking the time
from the plaintiff, gave three tremendous cheers for the defendant,
and, after having shaken hands all round, left him.</p>

<p>The cavalcade gave three tremendous

<p>Sam, having been formally delivered into the warden&rsquo;s custody,
to the intense astonishment of Roker, and to the evident emotion
of even the phlegmatic Neddy, passed at once into the prison,
walked straight to his master&rsquo;s room, and knocked at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>Sam appeared, pulled off his hat, and smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Sam, my good lad!&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, evidently delighted
to see his humble friend again; &ldquo;I had no intention of
hurting your feelings yesterday, my faithful fellow, by what I
said. Put down your hat, Sam, and let me explain my meaning, a
little more at length.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t presently do, sir?&rdquo; inquired Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &ldquo;but why not now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rayther not now, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause&mdash;&rdquo; said Sam, hesitating.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because of what?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick, alarmed at his
follower&rsquo;s manner. &ldquo;Speak out, Sam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause,&rdquo; rejoined Sam; &ldquo;&rsquo;cause I&rsquo;ve got a little bisness as I
want to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What business?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick, surprised at Sam&rsquo;s
confused manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; partickler, sir,&rdquo; replied Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, if it&rsquo;s nothing particular,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with a
smile, &ldquo;you can speak with me first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d better see arter it at once,&rdquo; said Sam, still
hesitating.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick looked amazed, but said nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said Sam, stopping short.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;Speak out, Sam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the fact is,&rdquo; said Sam, with a desperate effort, &ldquo;p&rsquo;raps
I&rsquo;d better see arter my bed afore I do anythin&rsquo; else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Your bed!</em>&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, in astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my bed, sir,&rdquo; replied Sam. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a pris&rsquo;ner. I was
arrested, this here wery arternoon, for debt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You arrested for debt!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, sinking into
a chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, for debt, sir,&rdquo; replied Sam. &ldquo;And the man as puts me
in, &rsquo;ull never let me out, till you go yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless my heart and soul!&rdquo; ejaculated Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;What
do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot I say, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Sam. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s forty year to come,
I shall be a prisoner, and I&rsquo;m very glad on it, and if it had been
Newgate, it would ha&rsquo; been just the same. Now the murder&rsquo;s out,
and damme, there&rsquo;s an end on it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With these words, which he repeated with great emphasis and
violence, Sam Weller dashed his hat upon the ground, in a most
unusual state of excitement; and then, folding his arms, looked
firmly and fixedly in his master&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Mr. Pickwick</span> felt a great deal too much
touched by the warmth of Sam&rsquo;s attachment,
to be able to exhibit any manifestation of
anger or displeasure at the precipitate course
he had adopted, in voluntarily consigning
himself to a debtor&rsquo;s prison, for an indefinite
period. The only point on which he persevered in demanding
any explanation, was, the name of Sam&rsquo;s detaining creditor; but
this Mr. Weller as perseveringly withheld.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t o&rsquo; no use, sir,&rdquo; said Sam, again and again. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
a ma-licious, bad-disposed, vorldly-minded, spiteful, windictive
creetur, with a hard heart as there ain&rsquo;t no soft&rsquo;nin&rsquo;. As the
wirtuous clergyman remarked of the old gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n with the dropsy,
ven he said that upon the whole he thought he&rsquo;d rayther leave his
property to his vife than build a chapel vith it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But consider, Sam,&rdquo; Mr. Pickwick remonstrated, &ldquo;the sum
is so small that it can very easily be paid; and having made up my
mind that you shall stop with me, you should recollect how much
more useful you would be, if you could go outside the walls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wery much obliged to you, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller gravely;
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;d rayther not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather not do what, Sam?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wy, I&rsquo;d rayther not let myself down to ask a favour o&rsquo; this
here unremorseful enemy.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is no favour asking him to take his money, Sam,&rdquo;
reasoned Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beg your pardon, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Sam; &ldquo;but it &rsquo;ud be a wery
great favour to pay it, and he don&rsquo;t deserve none; that&rsquo;s where
it is, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Mr. Pickwick, rubbing his nose with an air of some vexation,
Mr. Weller thought it prudent to change the theme of the
discourse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I takes my determination on principle, sir,&rdquo; remarked Sam,
&ldquo;and you takes yours on the same ground; vich puts me in mind
o&rsquo; the man as killed his-self on principle, vich o&rsquo; course you&rsquo;ve heerd
on, sir.&rdquo; Mr. Weller paused when he arrived at this point, and cast
a comical look at his master out of the corners of his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no &lsquo;of course&rsquo; in the case, Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick,
gradually breaking into a smile in spite of the uneasiness which
Sam&rsquo;s obstinacy had given him. &ldquo;The fame of the gentleman in
question never reached my ears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Weller. &ldquo;You astonish me, sir; he
wos a clerk in a Gov&rsquo;ment office, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was he?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he wos, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Weller; &ldquo;and a wery pleasant
gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n too&mdash;one o&rsquo; the precise and tidy sort, as puts their feet in
little india-rubber fire-buckets ven it&rsquo;s vet weather, and never has
no other bosom friends but hare-skins; he saved up his money on
principle, wore a clean shirt ev&rsquo;ry day on principle; never spoke
to none of his relations on principle, &rsquo;fear they shou&rsquo;d want to
borrow money of him; and wos altogether, in fact, an uncommon
agreeable character. He had his hair cut on principle vunce a
fortnight, and contracted for his clothes on the economic principle&mdash;three
suits a year, and send back the old uns. Being a wery
reg&rsquo;lar gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n, he din&rsquo;d ev&rsquo;ry day at the same place, were it wos
one and nine to cut off the joint, and a wery good one and nine&rsquo;s
worth he used to cut, as the landlord often said, with the tears a
tricklin&rsquo; down his face: let alone the way he used to poke the fire in
the vinter time, which wos a dead loss o&rsquo; fourpence ha&rsquo;penny a
day: to say nothin&rsquo; at all o&rsquo; the aggrawation o&rsquo; seein&rsquo; him do it.
So uncommon grand with it too! &lsquo;<cite>Post</cite> arter the next gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n,&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
he sings out ev&rsquo;ry day ven he comes in. &lsquo;See arter the <cite>Times</cite>,
Thomas; let me look at the <cite>Mornin&rsquo; Herald</cite>, wen it&rsquo;s out o&rsquo; hand;
don&rsquo;t forget to bespeak the <cite>Chronicle</cite>; and just bring the <cite>&rsquo;Tizer</cite>,
vill you?&rsquo; and then he&rsquo;d set vith his eyes fixed on the clock, and
rush out, just a quarter of a minit afore the time, to waylay the
boy as wos a comin&rsquo; in with the evenin&rsquo; paper, vich he&rsquo;d read
with such intense interest and persewerance as worked the other
customers up to the wery confines o&rsquo; desperation and insanity,
&rsquo;specially one i-rascible old gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n as the vaiter wos always
obliged to keep a sharp eye on, at sich times, &rsquo;fear he should be
tempted to commit some rash act with the carving-knife. Vell,
sir, here he&rsquo;d stop, occupyin&rsquo; the best place for three hours, and
never takin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; arter his dinner, but sleep, and then he&rsquo;d go
away to a coffee-house a few streets off, and have a small pot of
coffee and four crumpets, arter wich he&rsquo;d walk home to Kensington
and go to bed. One night he wos took very ill; sends
for a doctor; doctor comes in a green fly, with a kind o&rsquo; Robinson
Crusoe set o&rsquo; steps, as he could let down ven he got out, and
pull up arter him ven he got in, to perwent the necessity o&rsquo; the
coachman&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; down, and thereby undeceivin&rsquo; the public by
lettin&rsquo; em see that it wos only a livery coat as he&rsquo;d got on, and
not the trousers to match. &lsquo;Wot&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; said the
doctor. &lsquo;Wery ill,&rsquo; says the patient. &lsquo;Wot have you been a
eatin&rsquo; on?&rsquo; says the doctor. &lsquo;Roast weal,&rsquo; says the patient.
&lsquo;Wot&rsquo;s the last thing you dewoured?&rsquo; says the doctor.
&lsquo;Crumpets,&rsquo; says the patient. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rsquo; says the doctor.
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll send you a box of pills directly, and don&rsquo;t you never take
no more of &rsquo;em,&rsquo; he says. &lsquo;No more o&rsquo; wot?&rsquo; says the patient&mdash;&lsquo;Pills?&rsquo;
&lsquo;No; crumpets,&rsquo; says the doctor. &lsquo;Wy?&rsquo; says the
patient, starting up in bed; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve eat four crumpets ev&rsquo;ry night for
fifteen year, on principle.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well then, you&rsquo;d better leave &rsquo;em off,
on principle,&rsquo; says the doctor. &lsquo;Crumpets is wholesome, sir,&rsquo; says
the patient. &lsquo;Crumpets is <em>not</em> wholesome, sir,&rsquo; says the doctor,
wery fierce. &lsquo;But they&rsquo;re so cheap,&rsquo; says the patient, comin&rsquo; down
a little, &lsquo;and so wery fillin&rsquo; at the price.&rsquo; &lsquo;They&rsquo;d be dear to you,
at any price; dear if you wos paid to eat &rsquo;em,&rsquo; says the doctor.
&lsquo;Four crumpets a night,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;vill do your business in six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
months!&rsquo; The patient looks him full in the face, and turns it
over in his mind for a long time, and at last he says, &lsquo;Are you sure
o&rsquo; that &rsquo;ere, sir?&rsquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll stake my professional reputation on it,&rsquo;
says the doctor. &lsquo;How many crumpets, at a sittin&rsquo;, do you think,
&rsquo;ud kill me off at once?&rsquo; says the patient. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; says
the doctor. &lsquo;Do you think half-a-crown&rsquo;s vurth &rsquo;ud do it?&rsquo;
says the patient. &lsquo;I think it might,&rsquo; says the doctor. &lsquo;Three
shillin&rsquo;s vurth &rsquo;ud be sure to do it, I s&rsquo;pose?&rsquo; says the patient.
&lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; says the doctor. &lsquo;Wery good,&rsquo; says the patient;
&lsquo;good night.&rsquo; Next mornin&rsquo; he gets up, has a fire lit, orders in
three shillin&rsquo;s vurth o&rsquo; crumpets, toasts &rsquo;em all, eats&rsquo; em all, and
blows his brains out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did he do that for?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick, abruptly,
for he was considerably startled by this tragical termination of the
narrative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot did he do it for, sir?&rdquo; reiterated Sam. &ldquo;Vy, in support
of his great principle that crumpets wos wholesome, and to show
that he wouldn&rsquo;t be put out of his way for nobody!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With such like shiftings and changings of the discourse, did Mr.
Weller meet his master&rsquo;s questioning on the night of his taking up
his residence in the Fleet. Finding all gentle remonstrance useless,
Mr. Pickwick at length yielded a reluctant consent to his taking
lodgings by the week of a bald-headed cobbler, who rented a small
slip-room in one of the upper galleries. To this humble apartment
Mr. Weller moved a mattress and bedding which he hired of
Mr. Roker; and by the time he lay down upon it at night, was as
much at home as if he had been bred in the prison, and his whole
family had vegetated therein for three generations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you always smoke arter you goes to bed, old cock?&rdquo; inquired
Mr. Weller of his landlord, when they had both retired for
the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I does, young bantam,&rdquo; replied the cobbler.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you allow me to in-quire vy you make up your bed under
that &rsquo;ere deal table?&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause I was always used to a four-poster afore I came here, and
I find the legs of the table answer just as well,&rdquo; replied the cobbler.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a character, sir,&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got anything of the kind belonging to me,&rdquo; rejoined
the cobbler, shaking his head; &ldquo;and if you want to meet with a
good one, I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll find some difficulty in suiting yourself
at this register office.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The above short dialogue took place as Mr. Weller lay extended
on his mattress at one end of the room, and the cobbler on his, at
the other; the apartment being illumined by the light of a rush
candle, and the cobbler&rsquo;s pipe, which was glowing below the table,
like a red-hot coal. The conversation, brief as it was, predisposed
Mr. Weller strongly in his landlord&rsquo;s favour; and raising himself on
his elbow he took a more lengthened survey of his appearance than
he had yet had either time or inclination to make.</p>

<p>He was a sallow man&mdash;all cobblers are; and had a strong bristly
beard&mdash;all cobblers have. His face was a queer, good-tempered,
crooked-featured piece of workmanship, ornamented with a couple
of eyes that must have worn a very joyous expression at one time,
for they sparkled yet. The man was sixty, by years, and Heaven
knows how old by imprisonment, so that his having any look
approaching to mirth or contentment, was singular enough. He
was a little man, and being half doubled up as he lay in bed,
looked about as long as he ought to have been without his legs.
He had a great red pipe in his mouth, and was smoking, and
staring at the rushlight, in a state of enviable placidity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you been here long?&rdquo; inquired Sam, breaking the
silence which had lasted for some time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twelve year,&rdquo; replied the cobbler, biting the end of his pipe
as he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Contempt?&rdquo; inquired Sam.</p>

<p>The cobbler nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said Sam, with some sternness, &ldquo;wot do you
persewere in bein&rsquo; obstinit for, vastin&rsquo; your precious life away, in
this here magnified pound? Vy don&rsquo;t you give in, and tell the
Chancellorship that you&rsquo;re wery sorry for makin&rsquo; his court contemptible,
and you won&rsquo;t do so no more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cobbler put his pipe in the corner of his mouth, while he
smiled, and then brought it back to its old place again; but said
nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Vy don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Sam, urging his question strenuously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the cobbler, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t quite understand these
matters. What do you suppose ruined me, now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vy,&rdquo; said Sam, trimming the rushlight, &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose the beginnin&rsquo;
wos, that you got into debt, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never owed a farden,&rdquo; said the cobbler; &ldquo;try again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;you bought houses, vich is delicate
English for goin&rsquo; mad: or took to buildin&rsquo;, which is a medical term
for bein&rsquo; incurable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cobbler shook his had and said, &ldquo;Try again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t go to law, I hope?&rdquo; said Sam, suspiciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never in my life,&rdquo; replied the cobbler. &ldquo;The fact is, I was
ruined by having money left me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;that von&rsquo;t do. I wish some rich
enemy &rsquo;ud try to vork <em>my</em> destruction in that &rsquo;ere vay. I&rsquo;d let
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I dare say you don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; said the cobbler, quietly
smoking his pipe. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t if I was you; but it&rsquo;s true for all
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How wos it?&rdquo; inquired Sam, half induced to believe the fact
already, by the look the cobbler gave him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just this,&rdquo; replied the cobbler; &ldquo;an old gentleman that I
worked for, down in the country, and a humble relation of whose
I married&mdash;she&rsquo;s dead, God bless her, and thank Him for it!&mdash;was
seized with a fit and went off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; inquired Sam, who was growing sleepy after the
numerous events of the day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How should I know where he went?&rdquo; said the cobbler, speaking
through his nose in an intense enjoyment of his pipe. &ldquo;He
went off dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that indeed,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the cobbler, &ldquo;he left five thousand pound behind
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And wery gen-teel in him so to do,&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of which,&rdquo; continued the cobbler, &ldquo;he left to me, &rsquo;cause
I&rsquo;d married his relation, you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wery good,&rdquo; murmured Sam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And being surrounded by a great number of nieces and nevys,
as was always a quarrelling and fighting among themselves for the
property, he makes me his executor, and leaves the rest to me: in
trust, to divide it among &rsquo;em as the will prowided.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot do you mean by leavin&rsquo; it on trust?&rdquo; inquired Sam,
waking up a little. &ldquo;If it ain&rsquo;t ready money, where&rsquo;s the use
on it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a law term, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said the cobbler.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that,&rdquo; said Sam, shaking his head. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
wery little trust at that shop. Hows&rsquo;ever, go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the cobbler: &ldquo;when I was going to take out a
probate of the will, the nieces and nevys, who was desperately disappointed
at not getting all the money, enters a caveat against it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; inquired Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A legal instrument, which is as much as to say, it&rsquo;s no go,&rdquo;
replied the cobbler.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;a sort of brother-in-law o&rsquo; the have-his-carcase.
Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued the cobbler, &ldquo;finding that they couldn&rsquo;t
agree among themselves, and consequently couldn&rsquo;t get up a
case against the will, they withdrew the caveat, and I paid all the
legacies. I&rsquo;d hardly done it, when one nevy brings an action to set
the will aside. The case comes on some months afterwards afore
a deaf old gentleman, in a back room somewhere down by St.
Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard; and arter four counsels had taken a day
apiece to bother him regularly, he takes a week or two to consider,
and read the evidence in six vollums, and then gives his judgment
that how the testator was not quite right in his head, and I must
pay all the money back again, and all the costs. I appealed; the
case came on before three or four very sleepy gentlemen, who had
heard it all before in the other court, where they&rsquo;re lawyers without
work; the only difference being, that there they&rsquo;re called doctors,
and in the other places delegates, if you understand that; and they
very dutifully confirmed the decision of the old gentleman below.
After that, we went into Chancery, where we are still, and where
I shall always be. My lawyers have had all my thousand pound
long ago; and what between the estate, as they call it, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
costs, I&rsquo;m here for ten thousand, and shall stop here, till I die,
mending shoes. Some gentlemen have talked of bringing it before
parliament, and I dare say would have done it, only they hadn&rsquo;t
time to come to me, and I hadn&rsquo;t power to go to them, and they
got tired of my long letters, and dropped the business. And this
is God&rsquo;s truth, without one word of suppression or exaggeration, as
fifty people, both in this place and out of it, very well know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cobbler paused to ascertain what effect his story had produced
on Sam; but finding that he had dropped asleep, knocked
the ashes out of his pipe, sighed, put it down, drew the bedclothes
over his head, and went to sleep too.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick was sitting at breakfast, alone, next morning (Sam
being busily engaged in the cobbler&rsquo;s room, polishing his master&rsquo;s
shoes and brushing the black gaiters) when there came a knock at
the door, which, before Mr. Pickwick could cry &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; was
followed by the appearance of a head of hair and a cotton-velvet
cap, both of which articles of dress he had no difficulty in recognising
as the personal property of Mr. Smangle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; said that worthy, accompanying the inquiry
with a score or two of nods; &ldquo;I say&mdash;do you expect anybody
this morning? Three men&mdash;devilish gentlemanly fellows&mdash;have
been asking after you down-stairs, and knocking at every door on
the Hall flight; for which they&rsquo;ve been most infernally blown up
by the collegians that had the trouble of opening &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me! How very foolish of them,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick,
rising. &ldquo;Yes; I have no doubt they are some friends whom I
rather expected to see yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friends of yours!&rdquo; exclaimed Smangle, seizing Mr. Pickwick
by the hand. &ldquo;Say no more. Curse me, they&rsquo;re friends of mine
from this minute, and friends of Mivins&rsquo;s too. Infernal pleasant,
gentlemanly dog, Mivins, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; said Smangle, with great
feeling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know so little of the gentleman,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, hesitating,
&ldquo;that <span class="nobreak">I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you do,&rdquo; interposed Smangle, clasping Mr. Pickwick
by the shoulder. &ldquo;You shall know him better. You&rsquo;ll be delighted
with him. That man, sir,&rdquo; said Smangle, with a solemn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
countenance, &ldquo;has comic powers that would do honour to Drury
Lane Theatre.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has he indeed?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, by Jove he has!&rdquo; replied Smangle. &ldquo;Hear him come the
four cats in the wheelbarrow&mdash;four distinct cats, sir, I pledge you
my honour. Now you know that&rsquo;s infernal clever! Damme, you
can&rsquo;t help liking a man, when you see these traits about him. He&rsquo;s
only one fault&mdash;that little failing I mentioned to you, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Mr. Smangle shook his head in a confidential and sympathising
manner at this juncture, Mr. Pickwick felt that he was expected
to say something, so he said &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; and looked restlessly
at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; echoed Mr. Smangle, with a long-drawn sigh. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
delightful company, that man is, sir. I don&rsquo;t know better company
anywhere; but he has that one drawback. If the ghost of his
grandfather, sir, was to rise before him this minute, he&rsquo;d ask him
for the loan of his acceptance on an eighteenpenny stamp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Mr. Smangle; &ldquo;and if he&rsquo;d the power of raising
him again, he would, in two months and three days from this
time, to renew the bill!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those are very remarkable traits,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;m afraid that while we are talking here, my friends may be in
a state of great perplexity at not finding me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show &rsquo;em the way,&rdquo; said Smangle, making for the door.
&ldquo;Good day. I won&rsquo;t disturb you while they&rsquo;re here, you know.
By-the-<span class="nobreak">bye&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>As Mr. Smangle pronounced the last three words, he stopped
suddenly, re-closed the door which he had opened, and, walking
softly back to Mr. Pickwick, stepped close up to him on tip-toe,
and said in a very soft whisper:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t make it convenient to lend me half-a-crown till
the latter end of next week, could you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick could scarcely forbear smiling, but managing to
preserve his gravity, he drew forth the coin, and placed it in Mr.
Smangle&rsquo;s palm; upon which that gentleman, with many nods and
winks, implying profound mystery, disappeared in quest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
three strangers, with whom he presently returned; and having
coughed thrice, and nodded as many times, as an assurance to
Mr. Pickwick that he would not forget to pay, he shook hands
all round, in an engaging manner, and at length took himself off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear friends,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, shaking hands alternately
with Mr. Tupman, Mr. Winkle, and Mr. Snodgrass, who were the
three visitors in question, &ldquo;I am delighted to see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The triumvirate were much affected. Mr. Tupman shook his
head deploringly; Mr. Snodgrass drew forth his handkerchief with
undisguised emotion; and Mr. Winkle retired to the window, and
sniffed aloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mornin&rsquo;, gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n,&rdquo; said Sam, entering at the moment with
the shoes and gaiters. &ldquo;Avay with melincholly, as the little
boy said ven his school-missis died. Velcome to the College,
gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This foolish fellow,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, tapping Sam on the
head as he knelt down to button up his master&rsquo;s gaiters: &ldquo;this
foolish fellow has got himself arrested in order to be near me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed the three friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a&mdash;stand steady, sir, if you
please&mdash;I&rsquo;m a pris&rsquo;ner, gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n. Con-fined, as the lady said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A prisoner!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Winkle, with unaccountable
vehemence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hallo, sir!&rdquo; responded Sam, looking up. &ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s the matter,
sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had hoped, Sam, that&mdash;nothing, nothing,&rdquo; said Mr. Winkle
precipitately.</p>

<p>There was something so very abrupt and unsettled in Mr.
Winkle&rsquo;s manner, that Mr. Pickwick involuntarily looked at his
two friends for an explanation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mr. Tupman, answering this mute
appeal aloud. &ldquo;He has been much excited for two days past and
his whole demeanour very unlike what it usually is. We
feared there must be something the matter, but he resolutely
denies it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Mr. Winkle, colouring beneath Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
gaze; &ldquo;there is really nothing. I assure you there is nothing, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
dear sir. It will be necessary for me to leave town, for a short
time, on private business, and I had hoped to have prevailed upon
you to allow Sam to accompany me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick looked more astonished than before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; faltered Mr. Winkle, &ldquo;that Sam would have had
no objection to do so; but, of course, his being a prisoner here,
renders it impossible. So I must go alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Mr. Winkle said these words, Mr. Pickwick felt, with some
astonishment, that Sam&rsquo;s fingers were trembling at the gaiters
as if he were rather surprised or startled. Sam looked up at Mr.
Winkle, too, when he had finished speaking; and though the
glance they exchanged was instantaneous, they seemed to understand
each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know anything of this, Sam?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick
sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller, beginning to button
with extraordinary assiduity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure, Sam?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vy, sir,&rdquo; responded Mr. Weller; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure so far, that I&rsquo;ve
never heerd anythin&rsquo; on the subject afore this moment. If I
makes any guess about it,&rdquo; added Sam, looking at Mr. Winkle,
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got any right to say what it is, &rsquo;fear it should be
a wrong &rsquo;un.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no right to make any further inquiry into the private
affairs of a friend, however intimate a friend,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick,
after a short silence; &ldquo;at present let me merely say that I do
not understand this at all. There. We have had quite enough of
the subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus expressing himself, Mr. Pickwick led the conversation to
different topics, and Mr. Winkle gradually appeared more at ease,
though still very far from being completely so. They had all so
much to converse about, that the morning very quickly passed
away; and when, at three o&rsquo;clock, Mr. Weller produced upon the
little dining-table a roast leg of mutton and an enormous meat pie,
with sundry dishes of vegetables, and pots of porter, which stood
upon the chairs or the sofa-bedstead, or where they could, everybody
felt disposed to do justice to the meal, notwithstanding that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
the meat had been purchased, and dressed, and the pie made, and
baked, at the prison cookery hard by.</p>

<p>To these succeeded a bottle or two of very good wine, for which
a messenger was despatched by Mr. Pickwick to the Horn Coffee-house
in Doctors&rsquo; Commons. The bottle or two, indeed, might
be more properly described as a bottle or six, for by the time it
was drunk and tea over, the bell began to ring for strangers
to withdraw.</p>

<p>But if Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s behaviour had been unaccountable in the
morning, it became perfectly unearthly and solemn when, under
the influence of his feelings and his share of the bottle or six, he
prepared to take leave of his friend. He lingered behind, until Mr.
Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass had disappeared, and then fervently
clenched Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s hand, with an expression of face in which
deep and mighty resolve was fearfully blended with the very concentrated
essence of gloom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good night, my dear sir!&rdquo; said Mr. Winkle between his set
teeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless you, my dear fellow!&rdquo; replied the warm-hearted Mr.
Pickwick, as he returned the pressure of his young friend&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now then!&rdquo; cried Mr. Tupman from the gallery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, directly,&rdquo; replied Mr. Winkle. &ldquo;Good night!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>There was another good night, and another, and half-a-dozen
more after that, and still Mr. Winkle had fast hold of his friend&rsquo;s hand,
and was looking into his face with the same strange expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Is</em> anything the matter?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick at last, when his
arm was quite sore with shaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Mr. Winkle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well then, good night,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, attempting to
disengage his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friend, my benefactor, my honoured companion,&rdquo; murmured
Mr. Winkle, catching at his wrist. &ldquo;Do not judge me
harshly; do not, when you hear that, driven to extremity by
hopeless obstacles, <span class="nobreak">I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; said Mr. Tupman, reappearing at the door.
&ldquo;Are you coming, or are we to be locked in?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I am ready,&rdquo; replied Mr. Winkle. And with a violent
effort he tore himself away.</p>

<p>As Mr. Pickwick was gazing down the passage after them in
silent astonishment, Sam Weller appeared at the stair-head, and
whispered for one moment in Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, certainly, depend upon me,&rdquo; said that gentleman aloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thankee, sir. You won&rsquo;t forget, sir?&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; replied Mr. Winkle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wish you luck, sir,&rdquo; said Sam, touching his hat. &ldquo;I should
very much liked to ha&rsquo; joined you, sir; but the gov&rsquo;nor o&rsquo; course
is pairamount.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very much to your credit that you remain here,&rdquo; said
Mr. Winkle. With these words they disappeared down-stairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very extraordinary,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, going back into his
room, and seating himself at the table in a musing attitude.
&ldquo;What <em>can</em> that young man be going to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had sat ruminating about the matter for some time, when
the voice of Roker, the turnkey, demanded whether he might
come in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought you a softer pillow, sir,&rdquo; said Roker, &ldquo;instead
of the temporary one you had last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;Will you take a glass of wine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wery good, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Roker, accepting the
proffered glass. &ldquo;Yours, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to say that your landlord&rsquo;s every bad to-night, sir,&rdquo;
said Roker, setting down the glass, and inspecting the lining of his
hat preparatory to putting it on again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! The Chancery prisoner!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t be a Chancery prisoner wery long, sir,&rdquo; replied
Roker, turning his hat round, so as to get the maker&rsquo;s name
right side upwards, as he looked into it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You make my blood run cold,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;What
do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been consumptive for a long time past,&rdquo; said Mr. Roker,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
&ldquo;and he&rsquo;s taken wery bad in the breath to-night. The doctor said,
six months ago, that nothing but change of air could save him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great Heaven!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick; &ldquo;has this man
been slowly murdered by the law for six months!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; replied Roker, weighing the hat by
the brims in both hands. &ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;d have been took the same,
wherever he was. He went into the infirmary this morning; the
doctor says his strength is to be kept up as much as possible; and
the warden&rsquo;s sent him wine and broth and that, from his own
house. It&rsquo;s not the warden&rsquo;s fault, you know, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, hastily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, however,&rdquo; said Roker, shaking his head, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s
all up with him. I offered Neddy two sixpenn&rsquo;orths to one upon
it just now, but he wouldn&rsquo;t take it, and quite right. Thankee,
sir. Good night, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, earnestly. &ldquo;Where is this infirmary?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just over where you slept, sir,&rdquo; replied Roker. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show
you, if you like to come.&rdquo; Mr. Pickwick snatched up his hat
without speaking, and followed at once.</p>

<p>The turnkey led the way in silence; and gently raising the
latch of the room door, motioned Mr. Pickwick to enter. It was
a large, bare, desolate room, with a number of stump bedsteads
made of iron; on one of which lay stretched the shadow of a
man; wan, pale, and ghastly. His breathing was hard and thick,
and he moaned painfully as it came and went. At the bedside
sat a short old man in a cobbler&rsquo;s apron, who, by the aid of a
pair of horn spectacles, was reading from the Bible aloud. It was
the fortunate legatee.</p>

<p>The sick man laid his hand upon his attendant&rsquo;s arm, and
motioned him to stop. He closed the book and laid it on the bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Open the window,&rdquo; said the sick man.</p>

<p>He did so. The noise of carriages and carts, the rattle of wheels,
the cries of men and boys, all the busy sounds of a mighty multitude
instinct with life and occupation, blended into one deep
murmur, floated into the room. Above the hoarse loud hum
arose, from time to time, a boisterous laugh; or a scrap of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
jingling song, shouted forth by one of the giddy crowd, would
strike upon the ear for an instant, and then be lost amidst the
roar of voices and the tramp of footsteps; the breaking of the
billows of the restless sea of life that rolled heavily on without.
Melancholy sounds to a quiet listener at any time; how melancholy
to the watcher by the bed of death!</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no air here,&rdquo; said the sick man faintly. &ldquo;The place
pollutes it. It was fresh round about, when I walked there, years
ago; but it grows hot and heavy in passing these walls. I cannot
breathe it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have breathed it together for a long time,&rdquo; said the old
man. &ldquo;Come, come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a short silence, during which the two spectators
approached the bed. The sick man drew a hand of his old fellow-prisoner
towards him, and pressing it affectionately between both
his own, retained it in his grasp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; he gasped after a while, so faintly that they bent
their ears close over the bed to catch the half-formed sounds
his pale lips gave vent to: &ldquo;I hope my merciful Judge will
bear in mind my heavy punishment on earth. Twenty years,
my friend, twenty years in this hideous grave! My heart broke
when my child died, and I could not even kiss him in his little
coffin. My loneliness since then, in all this noise and riot, has been
very dreadful. May God forgive me! He has seen my solitary,
lingering death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He folded his hands, and murmuring something more they
could not hear, fell into a sleep&mdash;only a sleep at first, for they saw
him smile.</p>

<p>They whispered together for a little time, and the turnkey,
stooping over the pillow, drew hastily back. &ldquo;He has got his
discharge, by G&mdash;!&rdquo; said the man.</p>

<p>He had. But he had grown so like death in life, that they
knew not when he died.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">A few</span> mornings after his incarceration, Mr.
Samuel Weller, having arranged his master&rsquo;s room
with all possible care, and seen him comfortably
seated over his books and papers, withdrew to
employ himself for an hour or two to come,
as he best could. It was a fine morning, and it occurred to Sam
that a pint of porter in the open air would lighten his next quarter
of an hour or so, as well as any little amusement in which he
could indulge.</p>

<p>Having arrived at this conclusion, he betook himself to the tap.
Having purchased the beer, and obtained, moreover, the day-but-one-before-yesterday&rsquo;s
paper, he repaired to the skittle-ground, and
seating himself on a bench, proceeded to enjoy himself in a very
sedate and methodical manner.</p>

<p>First of all, he took a refreshing draught of the beer, and then he
looked up at the window, and bestowed a Platonic wink on a young
lady who was peeling potatoes thereat. Then he opened the paper,
and folded it so as to get the police reports outwards; and this
being a vexatious and difficult thing to do, when there is any wind
stirring, he took another draught of the beer when he had accomplished
it. Then he read two lines of the paper, and stopped
short to look at a couple of men who were finishing a game of
rackets, which being concluded, he cried out &ldquo;wery good&rdquo; in an
approving manner, and looked round upon the spectators, to ascertain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
whether their sentiments coincided with his own. This
involved the necessity of looking up at the windows also;
and as the young lady was still there, it was an act of common
politeness to wink again, and to drink to her good health in
dumb show, in another draught of the beer, which Sam did;
and having frowned hideously upon a small boy who had noted
this latter proceeding with open eyes, he threw one leg over the
other, and holding the newspaper in both hands, began to read in
real earnest.</p>

<p>He had hardly composed himself into the needful state of
abstraction, when he thought he heard his own name proclaimed
in some distant passage. Nor was he mistaken, for it quickly passed
from mouth to mouth, and in a few seconds the air teemed with
shouts of &ldquo;Weller!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; roared Sam, in a stentorian voice. &ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s the
matter? Who wants him? Has an express come to say that his
country-house is afire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody wants you in the hall,&rdquo; said a man who was standing
by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just mind that &rsquo;ere paper and the pot, old feller, will you?&rdquo;
said Sam. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a comin&rsquo;. Blessed, if they was a callin&rsquo; me to the
bar they couldn&rsquo;t make more noise about it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Accompanying these words with a gentle rap on the head of
the young gentleman before noticed, who, unconscious of his close
vicinity to the person in request, was screaming &ldquo;Weller!&rdquo; with
all his might, Sam hastened across the ground, and ran up the
steps into the hall. Here, the first object that met his eyes
was his beloved father sitting on a bottom stair, with his hat in
his hand, shouting out &ldquo;Weller!&rdquo; in his very loudest tone, at
half-minute intervals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot are you a roarin&rsquo; at?&rdquo; said Sam impetuously, when the
old gentleman had discharged himself of another shout; &ldquo;makin&rsquo;
yourself so precious hot that you looks like a aggrawated glass-blower.
Wot&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; replied the old gentleman, &ldquo;I began to be afeerd that
you&rsquo;d gone for a walk round the Regency Park, Sammy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;none o&rsquo; them taunts agin the wictim o&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
avarice, and come off that &rsquo;ere step. Wot are you a settin&rsquo; down
there for? I don&rsquo;t live there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got such a game for you, Sammy,&rdquo; said the elder Mr.
Weller, rising.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop a minit,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re all vite behind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Sammy, rub it off,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, as his son
dusted him. &ldquo;It might look personal here, if a man walked about
with whitevash on his clothes, eh, Sammy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Mr. Weller exhibited in this place unequivocal symptoms of
an approaching fit of chuckling, Sam interposed to stop it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep quiet, do,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;there never vos such a old
picter-card born. What are you bustin&rsquo; vith, now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sammy,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, wiping his forehead, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afeerd
that vun o&rsquo; these days I shall laugh myself into a appleplexy,
my boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vell then, wot do you do it for?&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;Now; wot
have you got to say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who do you think&rsquo;s come here with me, Samivel?&rdquo; said Mr.
Weller, drawing back a pace or two, pursing up his mouth, and
extending his eyebrows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pell?&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>Mr. Weller shook his head, and his red cheek expanded with
the laughter that was endeavouring to find a vent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mottled-faced man, p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps?&rdquo; suggested Sam.</p>

<p>Again Mr. Weller shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who then?&rdquo; asked Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your mother-in-law,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller; and it was lucky he
did say it, or his cheeks must inevitably have cracked from their
most unnatural distension.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your mother-in-law, Sammy,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, &ldquo;and the
red-nosed man, my boy; and the red-nosed man. Ho! ho! ho!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this, Mr. Weller launched into convulsions of laughter,
while Sam regarded him with a broad grin gradually overspreading
his whole countenance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve come to have a little serious talk with you, Samivel,&rdquo;
said Mr. Weller, wiping his eyes. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let out nothin&rsquo; about
the unnat&rsquo;ral creditor, Sammy.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot! don&rsquo;t they know who it is?&rdquo; inquired Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit on it,&rdquo; replied his father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vere are they?&rdquo; said Sam, reciprocating all the old gentleman&rsquo;s
grins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the snuggery,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Weller. &ldquo;Catch the red-nosed
man a goin&rsquo; anyvere but vere the liquors is; not he, Samivel,
not he. Ve&rsquo;d a wery pleasant ride along the road from the Markis
this mornin&rsquo;, Sammy,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, when he felt himself equal
to the task of speaking in an articulate manner. &ldquo;I drove the old
piebald in that &rsquo;ere little shay-cart as belonged to your mother-in-law&rsquo;s
first wenter, into vich a harm-cheer wos lifted for the shepherd;
and I&rsquo;m blest,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, with a look of deep scorn:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m blest if they didn&rsquo;t bring a portable flight o&rsquo; steps out into
the road a front o&rsquo; our door, for him to get up by.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="color08"></a>
<img src="images/color08.jpg" width="624" height="461" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>&ldquo;I drove the old piebald.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that?&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>do</em> mean that, Sammy,&rdquo; replied his father, &ldquo;and I vish
you could ha&rsquo; seen how tight he held on by the sides wen he did
get up, as if he wos afeerd o&rsquo; being precipitayted down full six
foot, and dashed into a million o&rsquo; hatoms. He tumbled in at
last, however, and avay ve vent; and I rayther think, I say I
rayther think, Samivel, that he found his-self a little jolted ven
ve turned the corners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot! I s&rsquo;pose you happened to drive up agin a post or two?&rdquo;
said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afeerd,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller, in a rapture of winks, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afeerd I took vun or two on &rsquo;em, Sammy; he wos a flyin&rsquo; out o&rsquo; the
harm-cheer all the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the old gentleman shook his head from side to side, and was
seized with a hoarse internal rumbling, accompanied with a violent
swelling of the countenance, and a sudden increase in the breadth
of all his features; symptoms which alarmed his son not a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened, Sammy, don&rsquo;t be frightened,&rdquo; said the
old gentleman, when by dint of much struggling, and various convulsive
stamps upon the ground, he had recovered his voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
only a kind o&rsquo; quiet laugh as I&rsquo;m a tryin&rsquo; to come, Sammy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if that&rsquo;s wot it is,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better not try to
come it agin. You&rsquo;ll find it rayther a dangerous inwention.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like it, Sammy?&rdquo; inquired the old gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; replied Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, with the tears still running down his
cheeks, &ldquo;it &rsquo;ud ha&rsquo; been a wery great accommodation to me if I
could ha&rsquo; done it, and &rsquo;ud ha&rsquo; saved a good many vords atween your
mother-in-law and me, sometimes; but I am afeerd you&rsquo;re right,
Sammy: it&rsquo;s too much in the appleplexy line&mdash;a deal too much,
Samivel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This conversation brought them to the door of the snuggery,
into which Sam&mdash;pausing for an instant to look over his shoulder,
and cast a sly leer at his respected progenitor, who was still giggling
behind&mdash;at once led the way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother-in-law,&rdquo; said Sam, politely saluting the lady, &ldquo;wery
much obliged to you for this here wisit. Shepherd, how air you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Samuel!&rdquo; said Mrs. Weller. &ldquo;This is dreadful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it, mum,&rdquo; replied Sam. &ldquo;Is it, shepherd?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Stiggins raised his hands, and turned up his eyes, till the
whites&mdash;or rather the yellows&mdash;were alone visible; but made no
reply in words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this here gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n troubled vith any painful complaint?&rdquo;
said Sam, looking to his mother-in-law for explanation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The good man is grieved to see you here, Samuel,&rdquo; replied
Mrs. Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s it, is it?&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;I was afeerd, from his
manner, that he might a&rsquo; forgotten to take pepper with that &rsquo;ere last
cowcumber he eat. Set down, sir, ve make no extra charge for the
settin&rsquo; down, as the king remarked ven he blowed up his ministers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said Mr. Stiggins ostentatiously, &ldquo;I fear you
are not softened by imprisonment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beg your pardon, sir,&rdquo; replied Sam; &ldquo;wot wos you graciously
pleased to hobserve?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I apprehend, young man, that your nature is no softer for
this chastening,&rdquo; said Mr. Stiggins, in a loud voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied Sam, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re wery kind to say so. I hope my
natur is <em>not</em> a soft vun, sir. Wery much obliged to you for your
good opinion, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this point of the conversation, a sound, indecorously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
approaching to a laugh, was heard to proceed from the chair in
which the elder Mr. Weller was seated; upon which Mrs. Weller,
on a hasty consideration of all the circumstances of the case, considered
it her bounden duty to become gradually hysterical.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weller,&rdquo; said Mrs. W. (the old gentleman was seated in a
corner); &ldquo;Weller! Come forth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wery much obleeged to you, my dear,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller;
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;m quite comfortable vere I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon this Mrs. Weller burst into tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s gone wrong, mum?&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Samuel!&rdquo; replied Mrs. Weller, &ldquo;your father makes me
wretched. Will nothing do him good?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you hear this here?&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;Lady wants to know
vether nothin&rsquo; &rsquo;ull do you good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wery much indebted to Mrs. Weller for her po-lite inquiries,
Sammy,&rdquo; replied the old gentleman. &ldquo;I think a pipe
vould benefit me a good deal. Could I be accommodated,
Sammy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Weller let fall some more tears, and Mr. Stiggins
groaned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hallo! Here&rsquo;s this unfort&rsquo;nate gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n took ill agin,&rdquo; said
Sam, looking round. &ldquo;Vere do you feel it now, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the same place, young man,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Stiggins: &ldquo;in
the same place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vere may that be, sir?&rdquo; inquired Sam, with great outward
simplicity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the buzzim, young man,&rdquo; replied Mr. Stiggins, placing his
umbrella on his waistcoat.</p>

<p>At this affecting reply, Mrs. Weller, being wholly unable to
suppress her feelings, sobbed aloud, and stated her conviction that
the red-nosed man was a saint; whereupon Mr. Weller senior
ventured to suggest, in an undertone, that he must be the representative
of the united parishes of St. Simon Without and St.
Walker Within.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afeerd, mum,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;that this here gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n, with
the twist in his countenance, feels rayther thirsty, with the melancholy
spectacle afore him. Is it the case, mum?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>The worthy lady looked at Mr. Stiggins for a reply; that
gentleman, with many rollings of the eye, clenched his throat with
his right hand, and mimicked the act of swallowing, to intimate
that he was athirst.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid, Samuel, that his feelings have made him so,
indeed,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weller, mournfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s your usual tap, sir?&rdquo; replied Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear young friend,&rdquo; replied Mr. Stiggins, &ldquo;all taps is
vanities!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too true, too true, indeed,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weller, murmuring a
groan, and shaking her head assentingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;I des-say they may be, sir; but which is your
partickler wanity? Vich wanity do you like the flavour on best, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear young friend,&rdquo; replied Mr. Stiggins, &ldquo;I despise
them all. If,&rdquo; said Mr. Stiggins, &ldquo;if there is any one of them
less odious than another, it is the liquor called rum. Warm, my
dear young friend, with three lumps of sugar to the tumbler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wery sorry to say, sir,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;that they don&rsquo;t allow that
partickler wanity to be sold in this here establishment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the hardness of heart of these inveterate men!&rdquo; ejaculated
Mr. Stiggins. &ldquo;Oh, the accursed cruelty of these inhuman
persecutors!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With these words Mr. Stiggins again cast up his eyes, and
rapped his breast with his umbrella; and it is but justice to the
reverend gentleman to say, that his indignation appeared very real
and unfeigned indeed.</p>

<p>After Mrs. Weller and the red-nosed gentleman had commented
on this inhuman usage in a very forcible manner, and had vented a
variety of pious and holy execrations against its authors, the latter
recommended a bottle of port wine, warmed with a little water,
spice, and sugar, as being grateful to the stomach, and savouring
less of vanity than many other compounds. It was accordingly
ordered to be prepared. Pending its preparation the red-nosed
man and Mrs. Weller looked at the elder W. and groaned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Sammy,&rdquo; said that gentleman, &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll find your
spirits rose by this here lively wisit. Wery cheerful and improvin&rsquo;
conwersation, ain&rsquo;t it, Sammy?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a reprobate,&rdquo; replied Sam; &ldquo;and I desire you won&rsquo;t
address no more o&rsquo; them ungraceful remarks to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So far from being edified by this very proper reply, the elder
Mr. Weller at once relapsed into a broad grin; and this inexorable
conduct causing the lady and Mr. Stiggins to close their eyes, and
rock themselves to and fro on their chairs in a troubled manner, he
furthermore indulged in several acts of pantomime, indicative of a
desire to pummel and wring the nose of the aforesaid Stiggins; the
performance of which appeared to afford him great mental relief.
The old gentleman very narrowly escaped detection in one instance:
Mr. Stiggins happening to give a start on the arrival of the negus,
brought his head in smart contact with the clenched fist with
which Mr. Weller had been describing imaginary fireworks in the
air, within two inches of his ear, for some minutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot are you a reachin&rsquo; out your hand for the tumbler in that
&rsquo;ere sawage way for?&rdquo; said Sam, with great promptitude. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you see you&rsquo;ve hit the gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t go to do it, Sammy,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, in some degree
abashed by the very unexpected occurrence of the incident.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try an in&rsquo;ard application, sir,&rdquo; said Sam, as the red-nosed
gentleman rubbed his head with a rueful visage. &ldquo;Wot do you
think o&rsquo; that, for a go o&rsquo; wanity warm, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Stiggins made no verbal answer, but his manner was
expressive. He tasted the contents of the glass which Sam had
placed in his hand; put his umbrella on the floor, and tasted it
again: passing his hand placidly across his stomach twice or thrice;
he then drank the whole at a breath, and smacking his lips, held out
the tumbler for more.</p>

<p>Nor was Mrs. Weller behind-hand in doing justice to the
composition. The good lady began by protesting that she couldn&rsquo;t
touch a drop&mdash;then took a small drop&mdash;then a large drop&mdash;then
a great many drops; and her feelings being of the nature of those
substances which are powerfully affected by the application of
strong waters, she dropped a tear with every drop of negus, and
so got on, melting the feelings down, until at length she had arrived
at a very pathetic and decent pitch of misery.</p>

<p>The elder Mr. Weller observed these signs and tokens with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
many manifestations of disgust, and when, after a second jug of
the same, Mr. Stiggins began to sigh in a dismal manner, he plainly
evinced his disapprobation of the whole proceedings, by sundry
incoherent ramblings of speech, among which frequent angry repetitions
of the word &ldquo;gammon&rdquo; were alone distinguishable to the ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you wot it is, Samivel, my boy,&rdquo; whispered the old
gentleman into his son&rsquo;s ear, after a long and steadfast contemplation
of his lady and Mr. Stiggins; &ldquo;I think there must be
somethin&rsquo; wrong in your mother-in-law&rsquo;s inside, as vell as in that
o&rsquo; the red-nosed man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot do you mean?&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean this here, Sammy,&rdquo; replied the old gentleman, &ldquo;that
wot they drink don&rsquo;t seem no nourishment to &rsquo;em; it all turns to
warm water, and comes a pourin&rsquo; out o&rsquo; their eyes. &rsquo;Pend upon it,
Sammy, it&rsquo;s a constitootional infirmity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Weller delivered this scientific opinion with many confirmatory
frowns and nods; which Mrs. Weller remarking, and concluding
that they bore some disparaging reference either to herself
or to Mr. Stiggins, or to both, was on the point of becoming
infinitely worse, when Mr. Stiggins, getting on his legs as well as he
could, proceeded to deliver an edifying discourse for the benefit of
the company, but more especially of Mr. Samuel, whom he adjured
in moving terms to be upon his guard in that sink of iniquity into
which he was cast; to abstain from all hypocrisy and pride of
heart; and to take in all things exact pattern and copy by him
(Stiggins), in which case he might calculate on arriving, sooner or
later, at the comfortable conclusion that, like him, he was a most
estimable and blameless character, and that all his acquaintance
and friends were hopelessly abandoned and profligate wretches.
Which consideration, he said, could not but afford him the liveliest
satisfaction.</p>

<p>He furthermore conjured him to avoid, above all things, the
vice of intoxication, which he likened unto the filthy habits of
swine, and to those poisonous and baleful drugs which, being
chewed in the mouth, are said to filch away the memory. At this
point of his discourse, the reverend and red-nosed gentleman
became singularly incoherent, and staggering to and fro in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
excitement of his eloquence, was fain to catch at the back of a
chair to preserve his perpendicular.</p>

<p>Mr. Stiggins did not desire his hearers to be upon their guard
against those false prophets and wretched mockers of religion, who,
without sense to expound its first doctrines, or hearts to feel its first
principles, are more dangerous members of society than the common
criminal; imposing, as they necessarily do, upon the weakest and
worst informed, casting scorn and contempt on what should be
held most sacred, and bringing into partial disrepute large bodies
of virtuous and well-conducted persons of many excellent sects
and persuasions. But as he leant over the back of the chair for a
considerable time, and closing one eye, winked a good deal with
the other, it is presumed that he thought all this, but kept it to
himself.</p>

<p>During the delivery of the oration, Mrs. Weller sobbed and wept
at the end of the paragraphs; while Sam, sitting cross-legged on
a chair and resting his arms on the top-rail, regarded the speaker
with great suavity and blandness of demeanour; occasionally
bestowing a look of recognition on the old gentleman, who was
delighted at the beginning, and went to sleep about half-way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brayvo; wery pretty!&rdquo; said Sam, when the red-nosed man,
having finished, pulled his worn gloves on: thereby thrusting his
fingers through the broken tops till the knuckles were disclosed to
view. &ldquo;Wery pretty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope it may do you good, Samuel,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weller,
solemnly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it vill, mum,&rdquo; replied Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could hope that it would do your father good,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thankee, my dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller senior. &ldquo;How do <em>you</em>
find yourself arter it, my love?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scoffer!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Benighted man!&rdquo; said the Reverend Mr. Stiggins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t get no better light than that &rsquo;ere moonshine o&rsquo;
yourn, my worthy creetur,&rdquo; said the elder Mr. Weller, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s wery
likely as I shall continey to be a night coach till I&rsquo;m took off the
road altogether. Now, Mrs. We, if the piebald stands at livery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
much longer, he&rsquo;ll stand at nothing as we go back, and p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps
that &rsquo;ere harm-cheer &rsquo;ull be tipped over into some hedge or
another, with the shepherd in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this supposition, the Reverend Mr. Stiggins, in evident consternation,
gathered up his hat and umbrella, and proposed an
immediate departure, to which Mrs. Weller assented. Sam walked
with them to the lodge-gate, and took a dutiful leave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A-do, Samivel,&rdquo; said the old gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s a-do?&rdquo; inquired Sammy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, good-bye, then,&rdquo; said the old gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s wot you&rsquo;re a aimin&rsquo; at, is it?&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sammy,&rdquo; whispered Mr. Weller, looking cautiously round;
&ldquo;my duty to your gov&rsquo;ner, and tell him if he thinks better o&rsquo; this
here bis&rsquo;ness, to commoonicate vith me. Me and a cab&rsquo;net-maker
has devised a plan for gettin&rsquo; him out. A pianner, Samivel, a
pianner!&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, striking his son on the chest with the
back of his hand, and falling back a step or two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot do you mean?&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pianner forty, Samivel,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Weller, in a still more
mysterious manner, &ldquo;as we can have on hire; vun as von&rsquo;t play,
Sammy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And wot &rsquo;ud be the good o&rsquo; that?&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let him send to my friend, the cab&rsquo;net-maker, to fetch it
back, Sammy,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller. &ldquo;Are you avake now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; rejoined Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no vurks in it,&rdquo; whispered his father. &ldquo;It &rsquo;ull
hold him easy, vith his hat and shoes on, and breathe through the
legs, vich his holler. Have a passage ready taken for &rsquo;Merriker. The
&rsquo;Merrikin gov&rsquo;ment will never give him up, ven they find as he&rsquo;s
got money to spend, Sammy. Let the gov&rsquo;ner stop there, till Mrs.
Bardell&rsquo;s dead, or Mr. Dodson and Fogg&rsquo;s hung (which last ewent
I think is the most likely to happen first, Sammy), and then let him
come back and write a book about the &rsquo;Merrikins, as&rsquo;ll pay all his
expenses and more, if he blows &rsquo;em up enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Weller delivered this hurried abstract of his plot with great
vehemence of whisper; then, as if fearful of weakening the effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
of the tremendous communication, by any further dialogue, he gave
the coachman&rsquo;s salute, and vanished.</p>

<p>Sam had scarcely recovered his usual composure of countenance,
which had been greatly disturbed by the secret communication of
his respected relative, when Mr. Pickwick accosted him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; said that gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir?&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going for a walk round the prison, and I wish you to
attend me. I see a prisoner we know coming this way, Sam,&rdquo; said
Mr. Pickwick, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wich, sir?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Weller; &ldquo;the gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n vith the
head o&rsquo; hair, or the interestin&rsquo; captive in the stockin&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;He is an older friend of
yours, Sam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O&rsquo; mine, sir?&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You recollect the gentleman very well, I dare say, Sam,&rdquo; replied
Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;or else you are more unmindful of your old
acquaintances than I think you are. Hush! not a word, Sam;
not a syllable. Here he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Mr. Pickwick spoke, Jingle walked up. He looked less
miserable than before, being clad in a half-worn suit of clothes,
which, with Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s assistance, had been released from the
pawnbroker&rsquo;s. He wore clean linen too, and had had his hair cut.
He was very pale and thin, however; and as he crept slowly up,
leaning on a stick, it was easy to see that he had suffered severely
from illness and want, and was still very weak. He took off his
hat as Mr. Pickwick saluted him, and seemed much humbled and
abashed at sight of Sam Weller.</p>

<p>Following close at his heels, came Mr. Job Trotter, in the
catalogue of whose vices, want of faith and attachment to his
companion could at all events find no place. He was still ragged
and squalid, but his face was not quite so hollow as on his first
meeting with Mr. Pickwick a few days before. As he took off
his hat to our benevolent old friend, he murmured some broken
expressions of gratitude, and muttered something about having
been saved from starving.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, impatiently interrupting him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
&ldquo;you can follow with Sam. I want to speak to you, Mr. Jingle.
Can you walk without his arm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, sir&mdash;all ready&mdash;not too fast&mdash;legs&mdash;shaky&mdash;head
queer round and round&mdash;earthquaky sort of feeling&mdash;very.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, give me your arm,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied Jingle; &ldquo;won&rsquo;t indeed&mdash;rather not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &ldquo;lean upon me, I desire,
sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seeing that he was confused and agitated, and uncertain what
to do, Mr. Pickwick cut the matter short by drawing the invalided
stroller&rsquo;s arm through his, and leading him away, without saying
another word about it.</p>

<p>During the whole of this time, the countenance of Mr. Samuel
Weller had exhibited an expression of the most overwhelming and
absorbing astonishment that the imagination can portray. After
looking from Job to Jingle, and from Jingle to Job, in profound
silence, he softly ejaculated the words, &ldquo;Well, I <em>am</em> damn&rsquo;d!&rdquo;
Which he repeated at least a score of times: after which exertion,
he appeared wholly bereft of speech, and again cast his eyes, first
upon the one and then upon the other, in mute perplexity and
bewilderment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Sam!&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, looking back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a comin&rsquo;, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller, mechanically following
his master; and still he lifted not his eyes from Mr. Job Trotter,
who walked at his side, in silence.</p>

<p>Job kept his eyes fixed on the ground for some time. Sam, with
his glued to Job&rsquo;s countenance, ran up against the people who were
walking about, and fell over little children, and stumbled against
steps and railings, without appearing at all sensible of it, until Job,
looking stealthily up, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Weller?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It <em>is</em> him!&rdquo; exclaimed Sam: and having established Job&rsquo;s
identity beyond all doubt, he smote his leg, and vented his feelings
in a long shrill whistle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Things has altered with me, sir,&rdquo; said Job.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think they had,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Weller, surveying his
companion&rsquo;s rags with undisguised wonder. &ldquo;This is rayther a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
change for the worse, Mr. Trotter, as the gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n said wen he
got two doubtful shillin&rsquo;s and sixpenn&rsquo;orth o&rsquo; pocket pieces for
a good half-crown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is indeed,&rdquo; replied Job, shaking his head. &ldquo;There is no
deception now, Mr. Weller. Tears,&rdquo; said Job, with a look of
momentary slyness, &ldquo;tears are not the only proofs of distress, nor
the best ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, they ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Sam, expressively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They may be put on, Mr. Weller,&rdquo; said Job.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know they may,&rdquo; said Sam; &ldquo;some people, indeed, has
&rsquo;em always ready laid on, and can pull out the plug wenever
they likes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Job; &ldquo;but <em>these</em> sort of things are not so easily
counterfeited, Mr. Weller, and it is a more painful process to get
them up.&rdquo; As he spoke, he pointed to his sallow, sunken cheeks,
and, drawing up his coat sleeves, disclosed an arm which looked
as if the bone could be broken at a touch: so sharp and brittle
did it appear beneath its thin covering of flesh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot have you been a doin&rsquo; to yourself?&rdquo; said Sam, recoiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; replied Job.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;!&rdquo; echoed Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been doin&rsquo; nothing for many weeks past,&rdquo; said Job;
&ldquo;and eating and drinking almost as little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam took one comprehensive glance at Mr. Trotter&rsquo;s thin
face and wretched apparel; and then, seizing him by the arm,
commenced dragging him away with great violence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you going, Mr. Weller?&rdquo; said Job, vainly struggling
in the powerful grasp of his old enemy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said Sam; &ldquo;come on!&rdquo; He deigned no further
explanation until they reached the tap; and then called for a pot
of porter which was speedily produced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;drink that up, ev&rsquo;ry drop on it, and then
turn the pot upside down, to let me see as you&rsquo;ve took the
med&rsquo;cine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear Mr. Weller,&rdquo; remonstrated Job.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down vith it!&rdquo; said Sam peremptorily.</p>

<p>Thus admonished, Mr. Trotter raised the pot to his lips, and, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
gentle and almost imperceptible degrees, tilted it into the air. He
paused once, and only once, to draw a long breath, but without
raising his face from the vessel, which, in a few moments thereafter,
he held out at arm&rsquo;s length, bottom upward. Nothing
fell upon the ground but a few particles of froth, which slowly
detached themselves from the rim, and trickled lazily down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well done!&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;How do you find yourself
arter it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better, sir. I think I am better,&rdquo; responded Job.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O&rsquo; course you air,&rdquo; said Sam, argumentatively. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like
puttin&rsquo; gas in a balloon. I can see with the naked eye that you
gets stouter under the operation. Wot do you say to another o&rsquo;
the same di-mensions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would rather not, I am much obliged to you, sir,&rdquo; replied
Job, &ldquo;much rather not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vell then, wot do you say to some wittles?&rdquo; inquired
Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks to your worthy governor, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Trotter, &ldquo;we
have half a leg of mutton, baked, at a quarter before three, with
the potatoes under it to save boiling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot! Has <em>he</em> been a purwidin&rsquo; for you?&rdquo; asked Sam
emphatically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has, sir,&rdquo; replied Job. &ldquo;More than that, Mr. Weller;
my master being very ill, he got us a room&mdash;we were in a kennel
before&mdash;and paid for it, sir; and come to look at us, at night,
when nobody should know. Mr. Weller,&rdquo; said Job, with real tears
in his eyes for once, &ldquo;I could serve that gentleman till I fell
down dead at his feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say!&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll trouble you, my friend! None o&rsquo;
that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Job Trotter looked amazed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None o&rsquo; that, I say, young feller,&rdquo; repeated Sam firmly. &ldquo;No
man serves him but me. And now we&rsquo;re upon it, I&rsquo;ll let you into
another secret besides that,&rdquo; said Sam, as he paid for the beer. &ldquo;I
never heerd, mind you, nor read of it in story-books, nor see in
picters, any angel in tights and gaiters&mdash;not even in spectacles, as I
remember, though that may ha&rsquo; been done for anythin&rsquo; I know to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
the contrairey&mdash;but mark my vords, Job Trotter, he&rsquo;s a reg&rsquo;lar
thorough-bred angel for all that; and let me see the man as
wenturs to tell me he knows a better vun.&rdquo; With this defiance,
Mr. Weller buttoned up his change in a side pocket, and, with
many confirmatory nods and gestures by the way, proceeded in
search of the subject of discourse.</p>

<p>They found Mr. Pickwick, in company with Jingle, talking
very earnestly, and not bestowing a look on the groups who
were congregated on the racket-ground; they were very
motley groups too, and worth the looking at if it were only in
idle curiosity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, as Sam and his companion drew
nigh, &ldquo;you will see how your health becomes, and think about it
meanwhile. Make the statement out for me when you feel yourself
equal to the task, and I will discuss the subject with you when
I have considered it. Now, go to your room. You are tired, and
not strong enough to be out long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Alfred Jingle, without one spark of his old animation&mdash;with
nothing even of the dismal gaiety which he had assumed when Mr.
Pickwick first stumbled on him in his misery&mdash;bowed low without
speaking, and, motioning to Job not to follow him just yet, crept
slowly away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Curious scene this, is it not, Sam?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, looking
good-humouredly round.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wery much so, sir,&rdquo; replied Sam. &ldquo;Wonders &rsquo;ull never
cease,&rdquo; added Sam, speaking to himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m wery much mistaken
if that &rsquo;ere Jingle worn&rsquo;t a doin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; in the water-cart
way!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The area formed by the wall in that part of the Fleet in which
Mr. Pickwick stood was just wide enough to make a good racket-court;
one side being formed, of course, by the wall itself, and
the other by that portion of the prison which looked (or rather
would have looked, but for the wall) towards St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral.
Sauntering or sitting about, in every possible attitude of listless
idleness, were a great number of debtors, the major part
of whom were waiting in prison until their day of &ldquo;going up&rdquo;
before the Insolvent Court should arrive; while others had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
remanded for various terms, which they were idling away as they
best could. Some were shabby, some were smart, many dirty, a
few clean; but there they all lounged, and loitered, and slunk
about, with as little spirit or purpose as the beasts in a menagerie.</p>

<p>Lolling from the windows which commanded a view of this
promenade, were a number of persons, some in noisy conversation
with their acquaintance below, others playing at ball with some
adventurous throwers outside, others looking on at the racket-players,
or watching the boys as they cried the game. Dirty, slipshod
women passed and re-passed on their way to the cooking-house
in one corner of the yard; children screamed, and fought,
and played together, in another; the tumbling of the skittles, and
the shouts of the players, mingled perpetually with these and a
hundred other sounds; and all was noise and tumult&mdash;save in
a little miserable shed a few yards off, where lay, all quiet and
ghastly, the body of the Chancery prisoner who had died the
night before, awaiting the mockery of an inquest. The body!
It is the lawyer&rsquo;s term for the restless whirling mass of cares
and anxieties, affections, hopes, and griefs, that make up the
living man. The law <em>had</em> his body; and there it lay, clothed
in grave-clothes, an awful witness to its tender mercy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you like to see a whistling-shop, sir?&rdquo; inquired Job
Trotter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; was Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s counter inquiry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A vistlin&rsquo; shop, sir,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that, Sam? A bird-fancier&rsquo;s?&rdquo; inquired Mr.
Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless your heart, no, sir,&rdquo; replied Job; &ldquo;a whistling-shop, sir,
is where they sell spirits.&rdquo; Mr. Job Trotter briefly explained here
that all persons being prohibited under heavy penalties from
conveying spirits into debtors&rsquo; prisons, and such commodities being
highly prized by the ladies and gentlemen confined therein, it
had occurred to some speculative turnkey to connive, for certain
lucrative considerations, at two or three prisoners retailing the
favourite article of gin, for their own profit and advantage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This plan you see, sir, has been gradually introduced into all
the prisons for debt,&rdquo; said Mr. Trotter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And it has this wery great advantage,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;that the
turnkeys takes wery good care to seize hold o&rsquo; ev&rsquo;rybody but them
as pays &rsquo;em, that attempts the willainy, and ven it gets in the
papers they&rsquo;re applauded for their wigilance; so it cuts two ways&mdash;frightens
other people from the trade, and elewates their own
characters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly so, Mr. Weller,&rdquo; observed Job.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, but are these rooms never searched to ascertain whether
any spirits are concealed in them?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cert&rsquo;nly they are, sir,&rdquo; replied Sam; &ldquo;but the turnkeys knows
beforehand, and gives the word to the wistlers, and you <em>may</em>
whistle for it ven you go to look.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time, Job had tapped at a door, which was opened
by a gentleman with an uncombed head, who bolted it after
them when they had walked in, and grinned; upon which Job
grinned, and Sam also; whereupon Mr. Pickwick, thinking it
might be expected of him, kept on smiling to the end of the
interview.</p>

<p>The gentleman with the uncombed head appeared quite satisfied
with this mute announcement of their business, and, producing
a flat stone bottle, which might hold about a couple of quarts,
from beneath his bedstead, filled out three glasses of gin, which
Job Trotter and Sam disposed of in a most workmanlike manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any more?&rdquo; said the whistling gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more,&rdquo; replied Job Trotter.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick paid, the door was unbolted, and out they
came; the uncombed gentleman bestowing a friendly nod upon
Mr. Roker, who happened to be passing at the moment.</p>

<p>From this spot, Mr. Pickwick wandered along all the galleries,
up and down all the staircases, and once again round the whole area
of the yard. The great body of the prison population appeared to
be Mivins, and Smangle, and the parson, and the butcher, and the
leg, over and over, and over again. There were the same squalor,
the same turmoil and noise, the same general characteristics, in
every corner; in the best and the worst alike. The whole place
seemed restless and troubled; and the people were crowding and
flitting to and fro, like the shadows in an uneasy dream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seen enough,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, as he threw himself
into a chair in his little compartment. &ldquo;My head aches with these
scenes, and my heart too. Henceforth I will be a prisoner in my
own room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Mr. Pickwick steadfastly adhered to this determination.
For three long months he remained shut up, all day; only stealing
out at night, to breathe the air, when the greater part of his fellow-prisoners
were in bed or carousing in their rooms. His health was
beginning to suffer from the closeness of the confinement, but
neither the often-repeated entreaties of Perker and his friends, nor
the still more frequently-repeated warnings and admonitions of
Mr. Samuel Weller, could induce him to alter one jot of his
inflexible resolution.</p>

</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">It</span> was within a week of the close of the month
of July, that a hackney cabriolet, number unrecorded,
was seen to proceed at a rapid pace
up Goswell Street; three people were squeezed
into it besides the driver, who sat in his own
particular little dickey at the side; over the
apron were hung two shawls, belonging to two
small vixenish-looking ladies under the apron;
between whom, compressed into a very small compass, was stowed
away a gentleman of heavy and subdued demeanour, who, whenever
he ventured to make an observation, was snapped up short
by one of the vixenish ladies before-mentioned. Lastly, the two
vixenish ladies and the heavy gentleman were giving the driver
contradictory directions, all tending to the one point that he
should stop at Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s door; which the heavy gentleman,
in direct opposition to, and defiance of, the vixenish ladies, contended
was a green door and not a yellow one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop at the house with the green door, driver,&rdquo; said the heavy
gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! You perwerse creetur!&rdquo; exclaimed one of the vixenish
ladies. &ldquo;Drive to the &rsquo;ouse with the yellow door, cabmin.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon this, the cabman, who in a sudden effort to pull up at
the house with the green door had pulled the horse up so high
that he nearly pulled him backward into the cabriolet, let the
animal&rsquo;s fore-legs down to the ground again, and paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now vere am I to pull up?&rdquo; inquired the driver. &ldquo;Settle
it among yourselves. All I ask is, vere?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the contest was renewed with increased violence; and the
horse being troubled with a fly on his nose, the cabman humanely
employed his leisure in lashing him about on the head, on the
counter-irritation principle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most wotes carries the day!&rdquo; said one of the vixenish ladies
at length. &ldquo;The &rsquo;ouse with the yellow door, cabmin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But after the cabriolet had dashed up, in splendid style, to the
house with the yellow door: &ldquo;making,&rdquo; as one of the vixenish
ladies triumphantly said, &ldquo;acterrally more noise than if one had
come in one&rsquo;s own carriage&rdquo;&mdash;and after the driver had dismounted
to assist the ladies in getting out&mdash;the small round head of Master
Thomas Bardell was thrust out of the one pair window of a house
with a red door, a few numbers off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aggrawatin&rsquo; thing!&rdquo; said the vixenish lady last mentioned,
darting a withering glance at the heavy gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, it&rsquo;s not my fault,&rdquo; said the gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me, you creetur, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorted the lady.
&ldquo;The house with the red door, cabmin. Oh! If ever a woman
was troubled with a ruffinly creetur, that takes a pride and pleasure
in disgracing his wife on every possible occasion afore strangers, I
am that woman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Raddle,&rdquo; said the other
little woman, who was no other than Mrs. Cluppins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have I been a doing of?&rdquo; asked Mr. Raddle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me, don&rsquo;t, you brute, for fear I should be
perwoked to forgit my sect and strike you!&rdquo; said Mrs. Raddle.</p>

<p>While this dialogue was going on, the driver was most ignominiously
leading the horse, by the bridle, up to the house with the
red door, which Master Bardell had already opened. Here was a
mean and low way of arriving at a friend&rsquo;s house! No dashing up,
with all the fire and fury of the animal; no jumping down of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
driver; no loud knocking at the door; no opening of the apron
with a crash at the very last moment, for fear of the ladies sitting
in a draught; and then the man handing the shawls out, afterwards,
as if he were a private coachman! The whole edge of the thing
had been taken off; it was flatter than walking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Tommy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Cluppins, &ldquo;how&rsquo;s your poor dear
mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s very well,&rdquo; replied Master Bardell. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s in the
front parlour, all ready. I&rsquo;m ready too, I am.&rdquo; Here Master
Bardell put his hands in his pockets, and jumped off and on the
bottom step of the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is anybody else a goin&rsquo;, Tommy?&rdquo; said Mrs. Cluppins,
arranging her pelerine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Sanders is going, she is,&rdquo; replied Tommy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
too, I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drat the boy!&rdquo; said little Mrs. Cluppins. &ldquo;He thinks of
nobody but himself. Here, Tommy, dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Master Bardell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who else is a goin&rsquo;, lovey?&rdquo; said Mrs. Cluppins in an insinuating
manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! Mrs. Rogers is a goin&rsquo;,&rdquo; replied Master Bardell, opening
his eyes very wide as he delivered the intelligence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! The lady as has taken the lodgings?&rdquo; ejaculated
Mrs. Cluppins.</p>

<p>Master Bardell put his hands deeper down into his pockets,
and nodded exactly thirty-five times, to imply that it was the
lady lodger, and no other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless us!&rdquo; said Mrs. Cluppins. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite a party!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, if you knew what was in the cupboard, you&rsquo;d say so,&rdquo;
replied Master Bardell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is there, Tommy?&rdquo; said Mrs. Cluppins, coaxingly.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll tell <em>me</em>, Tommy, I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Master Bardell, shaking his head, and
applying himself to the bottom step again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drat the child!&rdquo; muttered Mrs. Cluppins. &ldquo;What a prowokin&rsquo;
little wretch it is! Come, Tommy, tell your dear Cluppy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother said I wasn&rsquo;t to,&rdquo; rejoined Master Bardell. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
a goin&rsquo; to have some, I am.&rdquo; Cheered by this prospect, the
precocious boy applied himself to his infantile treadmill with
increased vigour.</p>

<p>The above examination of a child of tender years took place
while Mr. and Mrs. Raddle and the cab-driver were having an
altercation concerning the fare: which, terminating at this point
in favour of the cabman, Mrs. Raddle came up tottering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lauk, Mary Ann! what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; said Mrs. Cluppins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s put me all over in such a tremble, Betsy,&rdquo; replied Mrs.
Raddle. &ldquo;Raddle ain&rsquo;t like a man; he leaves everythink to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was scarcely fair upon the unfortunate Mr. Raddle, who had
been thrust aside by his good lady in the commencement of the
dispute, and peremptorily commanded to hold his tongue. He had
no opportunity of defending himself, however, for Mrs. Raddle
gave unequivocal signs of fainting; which being perceived from
the parlour window, Mrs. Bardell, Mrs. Sanders, the lodger, and
the lodger&rsquo;s servant, darted precipitately out, and conveyed her
into the house: all talking at the same time, and giving utterance
to various expressions of pity and condolence, as if she were one
of the most suffering mortals on earth. Being conveyed into the
front parlour, she was there deposited on a sofa; and the lady from
the first floor running up <em>to</em> the first floor, returned with a bottle of
sal volatile, which, holding Mrs. Raddle tight round the neck, she
applied in all womanly kindness and pity to her nose, until that
lady with many plunges and struggles was fain to declare herself
decidedly better.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, poor thing!&rdquo; said Mrs. Rogers, &ldquo;I know what her feelin&rsquo;s
is, too well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, poor thing! so do I,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sanders: and then all the
ladies moaned in unison, and said they knew what it was, and
they pitied her from their hearts, they did. Even the lodger&rsquo;s little
servant, who was thirteen years old, and three feet high, murmured
her sympathy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s been the matter?&rdquo; said Mrs. Bardell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, what has decomposed you, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; inquired Mrs.
Rogers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been a good deal flurried,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Raddle, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
reproachful manner. Thereupon the ladies cast indignant looks at
Mr. Raddle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the fact is,&rdquo; said that unhappy gentleman, stepping
forward, &ldquo;when we alighted at this door, a dispute arose with the
driver of the cabrioily&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; A loud scream from his wife, at
the mention of this word, rendered all further explanation inaudible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better leave us to bring her round, Raddle,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Cluppins. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll never get better as long as you&rsquo;re
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All the ladies concurred in this opinion; so Mr. Raddle was
pushed out of the room, and requested to give himself an airing in
the back yard. Which he did for about a quarter of an hour, when
Mrs. Bardell announced to him with a solemn face that he might
come in now, but that he must be very careful how he behaved
towards his wife. She knew he didn&rsquo;t mean to be unkind; but
Mary Ann was very far from strong, and, if he didn&rsquo;t take care, he
might lose her when he least expected it, which would be a very
dreadful reflection for him afterwards; and so on. All this Mr.
Raddle heard with great submission, and presently returned to the
parlour in a most lamb-like manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Mrs. Roger, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bardell, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve never
been introduced, I declare! Mr. Raddle, ma&rsquo;am; Mrs. Cluppins,
ma&rsquo;am; Mrs. Raddle, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which is Mrs. Cluppins&rsquo;s sister,&rdquo; suggested Mrs. Sanders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed!&rdquo; said Mrs. Rogers, graciously; for she was the
lodger, and her servant was in waiting, so she was more gracious
than intimate, in right of her position. &ldquo;Oh, indeed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Raddle smiled sweetly, Mr. Raddle bowed, and Mrs.
Cluppins said &ldquo;she was sure she was very happy to have a opportunity
of being known to a lady which she had heerd so much in
favour of, as Mrs. Rogers.&rdquo; A compliment which the last-named
lady acknowledged with graceful condescension.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Raddle,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bardell; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you ought
to feel very much honoured at you and Tommy being the only
gentlemen to escort so many ladies all the way to the Spaniards, at
Hampstead. Don&rsquo;t you think he ought, Mrs. Rogers, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, certainly, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rogers; after whom all the
other ladies responded &ldquo;Oh, certainly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I feel it, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Mr. Raddle, rubbing his
hands, and evincing a slight tendency to brighten up a little.
&ldquo;Indeed, to tell you the truth, I said, as we was a coming along
in the <span class="nobreak">cabrioily&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>At the recapitulation of the word which awakened so many
painful recollections, Mrs. Raddle applied her handkerchief to her
eyes again, and uttered a half-suppressed scream; so Mrs. Bardell
frowned upon Mr. Raddle, to intimate that he had better not
say anything more, and desired Mrs. Rogers&rsquo;s servant, with an
air, to &ldquo;put on the wine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was the signal for displaying the hidden treasures of the
closet, which comprised sundry plates of oranges and biscuits, and
a bottle of old crusted port&mdash;that at one and nine&mdash;with another of
the celebrated East India sherry at fourteen-pence, which were all
produced in honour of the lodger, and afforded unlimited satisfaction
to everybody. After great consternation had been excited in
the mind of Mrs. Cluppins, by an attempt on the part of Tommy
to recount how he had been cross-examined regarding the cupboard
then in action (which was fortunately nipped in the bud by
his imbibing half a glass of the old crusted &ldquo;the wrong way,&rdquo; and
thereby endangering his life for some seconds), the party walked
forth in quest of a Hampstead stage. This was soon found, and in
a couple of hours they all arrived safely in the Spaniards&rsquo; Tea-gardens,
where the luckless Mr. Raddle&rsquo;s very first act nearly occasioned
his good lady a relapse; it being neither more nor less than
to order tea for seven, whereas (as the ladies one and all remarked),
what could have been easier than for Tommy to have drank out
of anybody&rsquo;s cup&mdash;or everybody&rsquo;s, if that was all&mdash;when the waiter
wasn&rsquo;t looking: which would have saved one head of tea, and the
tea just as good!</p>

<p>However, there was no help for it, and the tea-tray came, with
seven cups and saucers, and bread and butter on the same scale.
Mrs. Bardell was unanimously voted into the chair, and Mrs
Rogers being stationed on her right hand, and Mrs. Raddle on her
left, the meal proceeded with great merriment and success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How sweet the country is, to be sure!&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Rogers;
&ldquo;I almost wish I lived in it always.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you wouldn&rsquo;t like that, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Bardell,
rather hastily; for it was not at all advisable, with reference to
the lodgings, to encourage such notions; &ldquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t like it,
ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I should think you was a deal too lively and sought-after
to be content with the country, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said little Mrs.
Cluppins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I am, ma&rsquo;am. Perhaps I am,&rdquo; sighed the first-floor
lodger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For lone people as have got nobody to care for them, or take
care of them, or as have been hurt in their mind, or that kind of
thing,&rdquo; observed Mr. Raddle, plucking up a little cheerfulness, and
looking round, &ldquo;the country is all very well. The country for a
wounded spirit, they say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, of all the things in the world that the unfortunate man
could have said, any would have been preferable to this. Of course
Mrs. Bardell burst into tears, and requested to be led from the
table instantly; upon which the affectionate child began to cry
too, most dismally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would anybody believe, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Raddle,
turning fiercely to the first-floor lodger, &ldquo;that a woman could be
married to such a unmanly creetur, which can tamper with a
woman&rsquo;s feelings as he does, every hour in the day, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; remonstrated Mr. Raddle, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean anything,
my dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t mean!&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Raddle, with great scorn
and contempt. &ldquo;Go away. I can&rsquo;t bear the sight on you, you
brute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not flurry yourself, Mary Ann,&rdquo; interposed Mrs.
Cluppins. &ldquo;You really must consider yourself, my dear, which
you never do. Now go away, Raddle, there&rsquo;s a good soul, or you&rsquo;ll
only aggravate her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better take your tea by yourself, sir, indeed,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Rogers, again applying the smelling-bottle.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sanders, who according to custom was very busy with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
bread and butter, expressed the same opinion, and Mr. Raddle
quietly retired.</p>

<p>After this, there was a great hoisting up of Master Bardell, who
was rather a large size for hugging, into his mother&rsquo;s arms: in
which operation he got his boots in the tea-board, and occasioned
some confusion among the cups and saucers. But that description
of fainting fits, which is contagious among
ladies, seldom lasts long; so when he had
been well kissed and a little cried over, Mrs.
Bardell recovered, set him down again, wondered
how she could have been so foolish,
and poured out some more tea.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that the sound of
approaching wheels was heard, and that the
ladies, looking up, saw a hackney-coach stop
at the garden-gate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More company!&rdquo; said Mrs. Sanders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a gentleman,&rdquo; said Mrs. Raddle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if it ain&rsquo;t Mr. Jackson, the young
man from Dodson and Fogg&rsquo;s!&rdquo; cried Mrs.
Bardell. &ldquo;Why, gracious! Surely Mr.
Pickwick can&rsquo;t have paid the damages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or hoffered marriage!&rdquo; said Mrs.
Cluppins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me, how slow the gentleman is,&rdquo;
exclaimed Mrs. Rogers: &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t he
make haste!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="caption">
<p>A shabby man in black
leggings</p>
</div></div>

<p>As the lady spoke these words, Mr. Jackson
turned from the coach where he had been addressing some
observations to a shabby man in black leggings, who had just
emerged from the vehicle with a thick ash-stick in his hand, and
made his way to the place where the ladies were seated; winding
his hair round the brim of his hat as he came along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is anything the matter? Has anything taken place, Mr.
Jackson?&rdquo; said Mrs. Bardell, eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing whatever, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied Mr. Jackson. &ldquo;How de
do, ladies? I have to ask pardon, ladies, for intruding&mdash;but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
law, ladies, the law.&rdquo; With this apology Mr. Jackson smiled, made
a comprehensive bow, and gave his hair another wind. Mrs.
Rogers whispered Mrs. Raddle that he was really an elegant
young man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I called in Goswell Street,&rdquo; resumed Jackson, &ldquo;and hearing
that you were here, from the slavey, took a coach and came on.
Our people want you down in the city directly, Mrs. Bardell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lor!&rdquo; ejaculated that lady, starting at the sudden nature of
the communication.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jackson, biting his lips. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very important and
pressing business which can&rsquo;t be postponed on any account. Indeed,
Dodson expressly said so to me, and so did Fogg. I&rsquo;ve kept
the coach on purpose for you to go back in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How very strange!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Bardell.</p>

<p>The ladies agreed that it <em>was</em> very strange, but were unanimously
of opinion that it must be very important, or Dodson and Fogg
would never have sent; and further, that the business being
urgent, she ought to repair to Dodson and Fogg&rsquo;s without any
delay.</p>

<p>There was a certain degree of pride and importance about being
wanted by one&rsquo;s lawyers in such a monstrous hurry, that was by
no means displeasing to Mrs. Bardell, especially as it might be
reasonably supposed to enhance her consequence in the eyes of the
first-floor lodger. She simpered a little, affected extreme vexation
and hesitation, and at last arrived at the conclusion that she
supposed she must go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But won&rsquo;t you refresh yourself after your walk, Mr. Jackson?&rdquo;
said Mrs. Bardell, persuasively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, really there ain&rsquo;t much time to lose,&rdquo; replied Jackson;
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve got a friend here,&rdquo; he continued, looking towards the man
with the ash stick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, ask your friend to come here, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bardell.
&ldquo;Pray ask your friend here, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, thankee, I&rsquo;d rather not,&rdquo; said Mr. Jackson, with some
embarrassment of manner. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not much used to ladies&rsquo;
society, and it makes him bashful. If you&rsquo;ll order the waiter to
deliver him anything short, he won&rsquo;t drink it off at once, won&rsquo;t he&mdash;only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
try him!&rdquo; Mr. Jackson&rsquo;s fingers wandered playfully round
his nose, at this portion of his discourse, to warn his hearers that he
was speaking ironically.</p>

<p>The waiter was at once despatched to the bashful gentleman,
and the bashful gentleman took something; Mr. Jackson also took
something, and the ladies took something, for hospitality&rsquo;s sake.
Mr. Jackson then said he was afraid it was time to go; upon which,
Mrs. Sanders, Mrs. Cluppins, and Tommy (who it was arranged
should accompany Mrs. Bardell: leaving the others to Mr. Raddle&rsquo;s
protection), got into the coach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isaac,&rdquo; said Jackson, as Mrs. Bardell prepared to get in:
looking up at the man with the ash stick, who was seated on the
box, smoking a cigar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>This</em> is Mrs. Bardell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I knowed that long ago,&rdquo; said the man.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bardell got in, Mr. Jackson got in after her, and away they
drove. Mrs. Bardell could not help ruminating on what Mr.
Jackson&rsquo;s friend had said. Shrewd creatures, those lawyers. Lord
bless us, how they find people out!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sad thing about these costs of our people&rsquo;s, ain&rsquo;t it,&rdquo; said
Jackson, when Mrs. Cluppins and Mrs. Sanders had fallen asleep;
&ldquo;your bill of costs, I mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry they can&rsquo;t get them,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Bardell.
&ldquo;But if you law-gentlemen do these things on speculation, why
you must get a loss now and then, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You gave them a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cognovit</i> for the amount of your costs, after
the trial, I&rsquo;m told?&rdquo; said Jackson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Just as a matter of form,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Bardell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Jackson, drily. &ldquo;Quite a matter of form.
Quite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On they drove, and Mrs. Bardell fell asleep. She was awakened,
after some time, by the stopping of the coach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless us!&rdquo; said the lady. &ldquo;Are we at Freeman&rsquo;s Court?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going quite so far,&rdquo; replied Jackson. &ldquo;Have the
goodness to step out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Bardell, not yet thoroughly awake, complied. It was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
curious place: a large wall, with a gate in the middle, and a gaslight
burning inside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, ladies,&rdquo; cried the man with the ash stick, looking into
the coach, and shaking Mrs. Sanders to wake her, &ldquo;Come!&rdquo;
Rousing her friend, Mrs. Sanders alighted. Mrs. Bardell, leaning
on Jackson&rsquo;s arm, and leading Tommy by the hand, had already
entered the porch. They followed.</p>

<p>The room they turned into was even more odd-looking than
the porch. Such a number of men standing about! And they
stared so!</p>

<p>&ldquo;What place is this?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Bardell, pausing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only one of our public offices,&rdquo; replied Jackson, hurrying her
through a door, and looking round to see that the other women
were following. &ldquo;Look sharp, Isaac!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Safe and sound,&rdquo; replied the man with the ash stick. The
door swung heavily after them, and they descended a small flight
of steps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here we are at last. All right and tight, Mrs. Bardell!&rdquo; said
Jackson, looking exultingly around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said Mrs. Bardell, with a palpitating
heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just this,&rdquo; replied Jackson, drawing her a little on one side;
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t be frightened, Mrs. Bardell. There never was a more
delicate man than Dodson, ma&rsquo;am, or a more humane man than
Fogg. It was their duty, in the way of business, to take you
in execution for them costs; but they were anxious to spare your
feelings as much as they could. What a comfort it must be to
you, to think how it&rsquo;s been done! This is the Fleet, ma&rsquo;am.
Wish you good night, Mrs. Bardell. Good night, Tommy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Jackson hurried away, in company with the man with the
ash stick, another man with a key in his hand, who had been
looking on, led the bewildered female to a second short flight of
steps leading to the doorway. Mrs. Bardell screamed violently;
Tommy roared; Mrs. Cluppins shrunk within herself; and Mrs.
Sanders made off, without more ado. For, there stood the injured
Mr. Pickwick, taking his nightly allowance of air; and beside
him leant Samuel Weller, who, seeing Mrs. Bardell, took his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
hat off with mock reverence, while his master turned indignantly
on his heel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother the woman,&rdquo; said the turnkey to Weller: &ldquo;she&rsquo;s
just come in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pris&rsquo;ner&rdquo; said Sam, quickly replacing his hat. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
the plaintives? What for? Speak up, old feller.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dodson and Fogg,&rdquo; replied the man; &ldquo;execution on cognovit
for costs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here Job, Job!&rdquo; shouted Sam, dashing into the passage.
&ldquo;Run to Mr. Perker&rsquo;s, Job. <em>I</em> want him directly. I see some good
in this. Here&rsquo;s a game. Hooray! vere&rsquo;s the gov&rsquo;nor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there was no reply to these inquiries, for Job had started
furiously off, the instant he received his commission, and Mrs.
Bardell had fainted in real downright earnest.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Job Trotter</span>, abating nothing of his speed,
ran up Holborn: sometimes in the middle of
the road, sometimes on the pavement, sometimes
in the gutter, as the chances of getting
along varied with the press of men, women,
children, and coaches, in each division of the
thoroughfare; regardless of all obstacles, he stopped not for an
instant until he reached the gate of Gray&rsquo;s Inn. Notwithstanding
all the expedition he had used, however, the gate had been closed
a good half-hour when he reached it, and by the time he had
discovered Mr. Perker&rsquo;s laundress, who lived with a married
daughter, who had bestowed her hand upon a non-resident waiter,
who occupied the one-pair of some number in some street closely
adjoining to some brewery somewhere behind Gray&rsquo;s Inn Lane, it
was within fifteen minutes of closing the prison for the night. Mr.
Lowten had still to be ferreted out from the back parlour of the
Magpie and Stump; and Job had scarcely accomplished this
object, and communicated Sam Weller&rsquo;s message, when the clock
struck ten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Lowten, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too late now. You can&rsquo;t get in
to-night; you&rsquo;ve got the key of the street, my friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind me,&rdquo; replied Job. &ldquo;I can sleep anywhere. But
won&rsquo;t it be better to see Mr. Perker to-night, so that we may
be there the first thing in the morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; responded Lowten, after a little consideration, &ldquo;if it
was in anybody else&rsquo;s case, Perker wouldn&rsquo;t be best pleased at my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
going up to his house; but as it&rsquo;s Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s, I think I may
venture to take a cab and charge it to the office.&rdquo; Deciding on
this line of conduct, Mr. Lowten took up his hat, and, begging
the assembled company to appoint a deputy chairman during his
temporary absence, led the way to the nearest coachstand. Summoning
the cab of most promising appearance, he directed the
driver to repair to Montague Place, Russell Square.</p>

<p>Mr. Perker had had a dinner party that day, as was testified by
the appearance of lights in the drawing-room windows, the sound
of an improved grand piano, and an improvable cabinet voice
issuing therefrom, and a rather overpowering smell of meat which
pervaded the steps and entry. In fact a couple of very good
country agencies happening to come up to town, at the same time,
an agreeable little party had been got together to meet them
comprising Mr. Snicks the Life Office Secretary, Mr. Prosee the
eminent counsel, three solicitors, one commissioner of bankrupts, a
special pleader from the Temple, a small-eyed peremptory young
gentleman his pupil, who had written a lively book about the law
of demises, with a vast quantity of marginal notes and references;
and several other eminent and distinguished personages. From
this society, little Mr. Perker detached himself, on his clerk being
announced in a whisper; and repairing to the dining-room, there
found Mr. Lowten and Job Trotter looking very dim and shadowy
by the light of a kitchen candle, which the gentleman who
condescended to appear in plush shorts and cottons for a
quarterly stipend, had, with a becoming contempt for the clerk
and all things appertaining to &ldquo;the office,&rdquo; placed upon the
table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Lowten,&rdquo; said little Mr. Perker, shutting the door,
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter? No important letter come in a parcel, is
there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied Lowten. &ldquo;This is a messenger from Mr.
Pickwick, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From Pickwick, eh?&rdquo; said the little man, turning quickly to
Job. &ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dodson and Fogg have taken Mrs. Bardell in execution for
her costs, sir,&rdquo; said Job.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; exclaimed Perker, putting his hands in his pockets, and
reclining against the sideboard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Job. &ldquo;It seems they got a cognovit out of her, for
the amount of &rsquo;em, directly after the trial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; said Perker, taking both hands out of his pockets,
and striking the knuckles of his right against the palm of his left,
emphatically, &ldquo;those are the cleverest scamps I ever had anything
to do with!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sharpest practitioners <em>I</em> ever knew, sir,&rdquo; observed Lowten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sharp!&rdquo; echoed Perker. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no knowing where to
have them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very true, sir, there is not,&rdquo; replied Lowten; and then, both
master and man pondered for a few seconds, with animated countenances,
as if they were reflecting upon one of the most beautiful
and ingenious discoveries that the intellect of man had ever made.
When they had in some measure recovered from their trance of
admiration, Job Trotter discharged himself of the rest of his
commission. Perker nodded his head thoughtfully, and pulled
out his watch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At ten precisely, I will be there,&rdquo; said the little man. &ldquo;Sam
is quite right. Tell him so. Will you take a glass of wine,
Lowten?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean yes, I think,&rdquo; said the little man, turning to the
sideboard for a decanter and glasses.</p>

<p>As Lowten <em>did</em> mean yes, he said no more on the subject, but
inquired of Job, in an audible whisper, whether the portrait of
Perker which hung opposite the fireplace, wasn&rsquo;t a wonderful likeness,
to which Job of course replied that it was. The wine being
by this time poured out, Lowten drank to Mrs. Perker and the
children, and Job to Perker. The gentleman in the plush shorts
and cottons considering it no part of his duty to show the people
from the office out, consistently declined to answer the bell, and
they showed themselves out. The attorney betook himself to his
drawing-room, the clerk to the Magpie and Stump, and Job to
Covent Garden Market to spend the night in a vegetable basket.</p>

<p>Punctually at the appointed hour next morning, the good-humoured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
little attorney tapped at Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s door, which was
opened with great alacrity by Sam Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Perker, sir,&rdquo; said Sam, announcing the visitor to Mr.
Pickwick, who was sitting at the window in a thoughtful attitude.
&ldquo;Wery glad you&rsquo;ve looked in accidentally, sir. I rather think the
gov&rsquo;ner wants to have a word and a half with you, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perker bestowed a look of intelligence on Sam, intimating that
he understood he was not to say he had been sent for: and beckoning
him to approach, whispered briefly in his ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that &rsquo;ere, sir?&rdquo; said Sam, starting back in
excessive surprise.</p>

<p>Perker nodded and smiled.</p>

<p>Mr. Samuel Weller looked at the little lawyer, then at Mr.
Pickwick, then at the ceiling, then at Perker again; grinned,
laughed outright, and, finally, catching up his hat from the carpet,
without further explanation, disappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick, looking at
Perker with astonishment. &ldquo;What has put Sam into this most
extraordinary state?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing, nothing,&rdquo; replied Perker. &ldquo;Come, my dear sir,
draw up your chair to the table. I have a good deal to say to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What papers are those?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick, as the little
man deposited on the table a small bundle of documents tied with
red tape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The papers in Bardell and Pickwick,&rdquo; replied Perker, undoing
the knot with his teeth.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick grated the legs of his chair against the ground;
and throwing himself into it, folded his hands and looked sternly&mdash;if
Mr. Pickwick ever could look sternly&mdash;at his legal friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like to hear the name of the cause?&rdquo; said the little
man, still busying himself with the knot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I do not indeed,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry for that,&rdquo; resumed Perker, &ldquo;because it will form the
subject of our conversation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would rather that the subject should be never mentioned
between us, Perker,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Pickwick, hastily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh, pooh, my dear sir,&rdquo; said the little man, untying the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
bundle, and glancing eagerly at Mr. Pickwick out of the corners
of his eyes. &ldquo;It must be mentioned. I have come on purpose.
Now, are you ready to hear what I have to say, my dear sir? No
hurry; if you are not, I can wait. I have this morning&rsquo;s paper
here. Your time shall be mine. There!&rdquo; Hereupon, the little
man threw one leg over the other, and made a show of beginning
to read with great composure and application.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick with a sigh, but softening
into a smile at the same time. &ldquo;Say what you have to say; it&rsquo;s
the old story, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With a difference, my dear sir; with a difference,&rdquo; rejoined
Perker, deliberately folding up the paper and putting it into his
pocket again. &ldquo;Mrs. Bardell, the plaintiff in the action, is within
these walls, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; was Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; retorted Perker. &ldquo;And you know how she comes
here, I suppose; I mean on what grounds, and at whose suit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; at least I have heard Sam&rsquo;s account of the matter,&rdquo; said
Mr. Pickwick, with affected carelessness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sam&rsquo;s account of the matter,&rdquo; replied Mr. Perker, &ldquo;is, I will
venture to say, a perfectly correct one. Well now, my dear sir, the
first question I have to ask, is, whether this woman is to remain
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To remain here!&rdquo; echoed Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To remain here, my dear sir,&rdquo; rejoined Perker, leaning back in
his chair and looking steadily at his client.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you ask me?&rdquo; said that gentleman. &ldquo;It rests with
Dodson and Fogg; you know that very well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know nothing of the kind,&rdquo; retorted Perker, firmly. &ldquo;It does
<em>not</em> rest with Dodson and Fogg; you know the men, my dear sir,
as well as I do. It rest solely, wholly, and entirely with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With me!&rdquo; ejaculated Mr. Pickwick, rising nervously from
his chair, and reseating himself directly afterwards.</p>

<p>The little man gave a double knock on the lid of his snuff-box,
opened it, took a great pinch, shut it up again, and repeated the
words, &ldquo;With you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, my dear sir,&rdquo; resumed the little man, who seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
gather confidence from the snuff; &ldquo;I say that her speedy liberation
or perpetual imprisonment rests with you, and with you alone.
Hear me out, my dear sir, if you please, and do not be so very
energetic, for it will only put you into a perspiration and do no
good whatever. I say,&rdquo; continued Perker, checking off each
position on a different finger, as he laid it down; &ldquo;I say that
nobody but you can rescue her from this den of wretchedness; and
that you can only do that, by paying the costs of this suit&mdash;both of
plaintiff and defendant&mdash;into the hands of these Freeman&rsquo;s Court
sharks. Now pray be quiet, my dear sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick, whose face had been undergoing most surprising
changes during this speech, and who was evidently on the verge of
a strong burst of indignation, calmed his wrath as well as he could.
Perker, strengthening his argumentative powers with another pinch
of snuff, proceeded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seen the woman, this morning. By paying the costs,
you can obtain a full release and discharge from the damages; and
further&mdash;this I know is a far greater object of consideration with
you, my dear sir&mdash;a voluntary statement, under her hand, in the
form of a letter to me, that this business was, from the very first,
fomented, and encouraged, and brought about, by these men,
Dodson and Fogg: that she deeply regrets ever having been the
instrument of annoyance or injury to you; and that she entreats
me to intercede with you, and implore your pardon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I pay her costs for her,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, indignantly.
&ldquo;A valuable document, indeed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No &lsquo;<em>if</em>&rsquo; in the case, my dear sir,&rdquo; said Perker, triumphantly.
&ldquo;There is the very letter I speak of. Brought to my office by
another woman at nine o&rsquo;clock this morning, before I had set foot
in this place, or held any communication with Mrs. Bardell, upon
my honour.&rdquo; Selecting the letter from the bundle, the little
lawyer laid it at Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s elbow, and took snuff for two
consecutive minutes, without winking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this all you have to say to me?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick,
mildly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; replied Perker. &ldquo;I cannot undertake to say, at
this moment, whether the wording of the cognovit, the nature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
the ostensible consideration, and the proof we can get together
about the whole conduct of the suit, will be sufficient to justify an
indictment for conspiracy. I fear not, my dear sir; they are too
clever for that, I doubt. I do mean to say, however, that the
whole facts, taken together, will be sufficient to justify you, in the
minds of all reasonable men. And now, my dear sir, I put it to
you. This one hundred and fifty pounds, or whatever it may be&mdash;take
it in round numbers&mdash;is nothing to you. A jury has decided
against you; well, their verdict is wrong, but still they decided as
they thought right, and it <em>is</em> against you. You have now an
opportunity, on easy terms, of placing yourself in a much higher
position than you ever could, by remaining here; which would
only be imputed, by people who didn&rsquo;t know you, to sheer dogged,
wrongheaded, brutal obstinacy: nothing else, my dear sir, believe
me. Can you hesitate to avail yourself of it, when it restores you
to your friends, your old pursuits, your health and amusements;
when it liberates your faithful and attached servant, whom you
otherwise doom to imprisonment for the whole of your life; and
above all, when it enables you to take the very magnanimous
revenge&mdash;which I know, my dear sir, is one after your own heart&mdash;of
releasing this woman from a scene of misery and debauchery
to which no man should ever be consigned, if I had my will, but
the infliction of which on any woman, is even more frightful and
barbarous. Now I ask you, my dear sir, not only as your legal
adviser, but as your very true friend, will you let slip the occasion
of attaining all these objects, and doing all this good, for the paltry
consideration of a few pounds finding their way into the pockets of
a couple of rascals, to whom it makes no manner of difference,
except that the more they gain, the more they&rsquo;ll seek, and so the
sooner be led into some piece of knavery that must end in a crash?
I have put these considerations to you, my dear sir, very feebly
and imperfectly, but I ask you to think of them. Turn them over
in your mind as long as you please. I wait here most patiently
for your answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before Mr. Pickwick could reply; before Mr. Perker had taken
one twentieth part of the snuff with which so unusually long an
address imperatively required to be followed up; there was a low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
murmuring of voices outside, and then a hesitating knock at the
door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, who had been evidently
roused by his friend&rsquo;s appeal; &ldquo;what an annoyance that door is!
Who is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me, sir,&rdquo; replied Sam Weller, putting in his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t speak to you just now, Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;I
am engaged at this moment, Sam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beg your pardon, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Weller. &ldquo;But here&rsquo;s a
lady here, sir, as says she&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; wery partickler to disclose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see any lady,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, whose mind was
filled with visions of Mrs. Bardell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I vouldn&rsquo;t make too sure o&rsquo; that, sir,&rdquo; urged Mr. Weller,
shaking his head. &ldquo;If you know&rsquo;d who was near, sir, I rayther
think you&rsquo;d change your note. As the hawk remarked to himself
with a cheerful laugh, ven he heard the robin redbreast a singin&rsquo;
round the corner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you see her, sir?&rdquo; asked Mr. Weller, holding the door in
his hand as if he had some curious live animal on the other side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I must,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, looking at Perker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well then, all in to begin!&rdquo; cried Sam. &ldquo;Sound the gong,
draw up the curtain, and enter the two con-spiraytors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Sam Weller spoke, he threw the door open, and there rushed
tumultuously into the room, Mr. Nathaniel Winkle: leading after
him by the hand, the identical young lady who at Dingley Dell had
worn the boots with the fur round the tops, and who, now a very
pleasing compound of blushes and confusion and lilac silk and a
smart bonnet and a rich lace veil, looked prettier than ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Arabella Allen!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, rising from
his chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Mr. Winkle, dropping on his knees, &ldquo;Mrs.
Winkle. Pardon, my dear friend, pardon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick could scarcely believe the evidence of his senses,
and perhaps would not have done so, but for the corroborative
testimony afforded by the smiling countenance of Perker, and the
bodily presence, in the background, of Sam and the pretty housemaid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
who appeared to contemplate the proceedings with the
liveliest satisfaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Pickwick!&rdquo; said Arabella, in a low voice, as if
alarmed at the silence. &ldquo;Can you forgive my imprudence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick returned no verbal response to this appeal; but
he took off his spectacles in great haste, and seizing both the
young lady&rsquo;s hands in his, kissed her a great number of times&mdash;perhaps
a greater number than was absolutely necessary&mdash;and
then, still retaining one of her hands, told Mr. Winkle he
was an audacious young dog, and bade him get up. This, Mr.
Winkle, who had been for some seconds scratching his nose with
the brim of his hat, in a penitent manner, did; whereupon Mr.
Pickwick slapped him on the back several times, and then shook
hands heartily with Perker, who, not to be behind-hand in the compliments
of the occasion, saluted both the bride and the pretty
housemaid with right good will, and, having wrung Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s
hand most cordially, wound up his demonstrations of joy by taking
snuff enough to set any half-dozen men, with ordinarily constructed
noses, a sneezing for life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my dear girl,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;how has all this
come about? Come! Sit down and let me hear all. How
well she looks, doesn&rsquo;t she, Perker?&rdquo; added Mr. Pickwick, surveying
Arabella&rsquo;s face with a look of as much pride and exultation,
as if she had been his daughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Delightful, my dear sir,&rdquo; replied the little man. &ldquo;If I were
not a married man myself, I should be disposed to envy you, you
dog.&rdquo; Thus expressing himself, the little lawyer gave Mr. Winkle
a poke in the chest, which that gentleman reciprocated; after which
they both laughed very loudly, but not so loudly as Mr. Samuel
Weller, who had just relieved his feelings by kissing the pretty
housemaid, under cover of the cupboard-door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can never be grateful enough to you, Sam, I am sure,&rdquo; said
Arabella, with the sweetest smile imaginable. &ldquo;I shall not forget
your exertions in the garden at Clifton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo; wotever about it, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied Sam. &ldquo;I
only assisted natur&rsquo;, ma&rsquo;am; as the doctor said to the boy&rsquo;s mother,
arter he&rsquo;d bled him to death.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mary, my dear, sit down,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, cutting short
these compliments. &ldquo;Now then; how long have you been
married, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arabella looked bashfully at her lord and master, who replied,
&ldquo;Only three days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only three days, eh?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;Why, what have
you been doing these three months?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, to be sure!&rdquo; interposed Perker; &ldquo;come! Account for
this idleness. You see Pickwick&rsquo;s only astonishment is, that it
wasn&rsquo;t all over months ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why the fact is,&rdquo; replied Mr. Winkle, looking at his blushing
young wife, &ldquo;that I could not persuade Bella to run away, for a
long time. And when I had persuaded her, it was a long time
more, before we could find an opportunity. Mary had to give a
month&rsquo;s warning too, before she could leave her place next door,
and we couldn&rsquo;t possibly have done it without her assistance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, who by this time
had resumed his spectacles, and was looking from Arabella to
Winkle, and from Winkle to Arabella, with as much delight depicted
in his countenance as warm-heartedness and kindly feeling
can communicate to the human face: &ldquo;Upon my word! you seem
to have been very systematic in your proceedings. And is your
brother acquainted with all this, my dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, no,&rdquo; replied Arabella, changing colour. &ldquo;Dear Mr.
Pickwick, he must only know it from you&mdash;from your lips alone.
He is so violent, so prejudiced, and has been so&mdash;so anxious in
behalf of his friend, Mr. Sawyer,&rdquo; added Arabella, looking down,
&ldquo;that I fear the consequences dreadfully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, to be sure,&rdquo; said Perker, gravely. &ldquo;You must take the
matter in hand for them, my dear sir. These young men will
respect you, when they would listen to nobody else. You must
prevent mischief, my dear sir. Hot blood, hot blood.&rdquo; And the
little man took a warning pinch, and shook his head doubtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You forget, my love,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, gently, &ldquo;you forget
that I am a prisoner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed I do not, my dear sir,&rdquo; replied Arabella. &ldquo;I
never have forgotten it. I have never ceased to think how great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
your sufferings must have been in this shocking place. But I
hoped that what no consideration for yourself would induce you
to do, a regard to our happiness might. If my brother hears of
this, first, from you, I feel certain we shall be reconciled. He is
my only relation in the world, Mr. Pickwick, and unless you plead
for me I fear I have lost even him. I have done wrong, very, very
wrong, I know.&rdquo; Here poor Arabella hid her face in her handkerchief,
and wept bitterly.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s nature was a good deal worked upon by these
same tears; but when Mrs. Winkle, drying her eyes, took to
coaxing and entreating in the sweetest tones of a very sweet voice,
he became particularly restless, and evidently undecided how to
act. As was evinced by sundry nervous rubbings of his spectacle-glasses,
nose, tights, head, and gaiters.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of these symptoms of indecision, Mr. Perker
(to whom, it appeared, the young couple had driven straight that
morning) urged with legal point and shrewdness that Mr. Winkle
senior was still unacquainted with the important rise in life&rsquo;s
flight of steps which his son had taken; that the future expectations
of the said son depended entirely upon the said Winkle senior
continuing to regard him with undiminished feelings of affection
and attachment, which it was very unlikely he would, if this great
event were long kept a secret from him; that Mr. Pickwick,
repairing to Bristol to seek Mr. Allen, might, with equal reason,
repair to Birmingham to seek Mr. Winkle senior; lastly, that Mr.
Winkle senior had good right and title to consider Mr. Pickwick
as in some degree the guardian and adviser of his son, and that
it consequently behoved that gentleman, and was indeed due to
his personal character, to acquaint the aforesaid Winkle senior
personally, and by word of mouth, with the whole circumstances
of the case, and with the share he had taken in the
transaction.</p>

<p>Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass arrived, most opportunely, in
this stage of the pleadings, and as it was necessary to explain
to them all that had occurred, together with the various reasons
pro and con, the whole of the arguments were gone over again,
after which everybody urged every argument in his own way, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
at his own length. And at last Mr. Pickwick, fairly argued and
remonstrated out of all his resolutions, and being in imminent
danger of being argued and remonstrated out of his wits, caught
Arabella in his arms, and declaring that she was a very amiable
creature, and that he didn&rsquo;t know how it was, but he had always
been very fond of her from the first, said he could never find it in
his heart to stand in the way of young people&rsquo;s happiness, and they
might do with him as they pleased.</p>

<p>Mr. Weller&rsquo;s first act, on hearing this concession, was to despatch
Job Trotter to the illustrious Mr. Pell, with an authority to deliver
to the bearer the formal discharge which his prudent parent had
had the foresight to leave in the hands of that learned gentleman,
in case it should be, at any time, required on an emergency; his
next proceeding was, to invest his whole stock of ready money in
the purchase of five-and-twenty gallons of mild porter: which he
himself dispensed on the racket-ground to everybody who would
partake of it; this done, he hurra&rsquo;d in divers parts of the building
until he lost his voice, and then quietly relapsed into his usual
collected and philosophical condition.</p>

<p>At three o&rsquo;clock that afternoon, Mr. Pickwick took a last look
at his little room, and made his way, as well as he could, through
the throng of debtors who pressed eagerly forward to shake him by
the hand, until he reached the lodge steps. He turned here, to
look about him, and his eyes lightened as he did so. In all the
crowd of wan, emaciated faces, he saw not one which was not the
happier for his sympathy and charity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perker,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, beckoning one young man towards
him, &ldquo;this is Mr. Jingle, whom I spoke to you about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good, my dear sir,&rdquo; replied Perker, looking hard at
Jingle. &ldquo;You will see me again, young man, to-morrow. I hope
you may live to remember and feel deeply what I shall have to
communicate, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jingle bowed respectfully, trembled very much as he took
Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s proffered hand, and withdrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Job you know, I think?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, presenting that
gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know the rascal,&rdquo; replied Perker, good-humouredly. &ldquo;See<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
after your friend, and be in the way to-morrow at one. Do you
hear? Now, is there anything more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;You have delivered the
little parcel I gave you for your old landlord, Sam?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have, sir,&rdquo; replied Sam. &ldquo;He bust out a cryin&rsquo;, sir, and said
you wos wery gen&rsquo;rous and thoughtful, and he only wished you
could have him innokilated for a gallopin&rsquo; consumption, for his old
friend, as had lived here so long, wos dead, and he&rsquo;d noweres to
look for another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor fellow, poor fellow!&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;God bless
you, my friends!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Mr. Pickwick uttered this adieu, the crowd raised a loud
shout. Many among them were pressing forward to shake him
by the hand again, when he drew his arm through Perker&rsquo;s, and
hurried from the prison: far more sad and melancholy, for the
moment, than when he had first entered it. Alas! how many sad
and unhappy beings had he left behind!</p>

<p>A happy evening was that, for, at least, one party in the George
and Vulture; and light and cheerful were two of the hearts that
emerged from its hospitable door next morning. The owners
thereof were Mr. Pickwick and Sam Weller, the former of whom
was speedily deposited inside a comfortable post coach, with a little
dickey behind, in which the latter mounted with great agility.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; called out Mr. Weller to his master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Sam?&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, thrusting his head out of
the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish them horses had been three months and better in the
Fleet, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Sam?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vy, sir,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Weller, rubbing his hands, &ldquo;how they
would go if they had been!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Mr. Ben Allen</span> and Mr. Bob Sawyer sat
together in the little surgery behind the
shop, discussing minced veal and future prospects,
when the discourse, not unnaturally,
turned upon the practice acquired by Bob
the aforesaid, and his present chances of deriving
a competent independence from the
honourable profession to which he had devoted himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Which, I think,&rdquo; observed Mr. Bob Sawyer, pursuing the
thread of the subject, &ldquo;which I think, Ben, are rather dubious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s rather dubious?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Ben Allen, at the same
time sharpening his intellects with a draught of beer. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
dubious?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the chances,&rdquo; responded Mr. Bob Sawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I forgot,&rdquo; said Mr. Ben Allen. &ldquo;The beer has reminded me
that I forgot, Bob&mdash;yes; they <em>are</em> dubious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful how the poor people patronise me,&rdquo; said Mr.
Bob Sawyer, reflectively. &ldquo;They knock me up at all hours of the
night; they take medicine to an extent which I should have conceived
impossible; they put on blisters and leeches with a perseverance
worthy of a better cause; they make additions to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
families, in a manner which is quite awful. Six of those last-named
little promissory notes, all due on the same day, Ben, and
all entrusted to me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very gratifying, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Mr. Ben Allen, holding his
plate for some more minced veal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, very,&rdquo; replied Bob; &ldquo;only not quite so much so, as the
confidence of patients with a shilling or two to spare would be.
This business was capitally described in the advertisement, Ben.
It is a practice, a very extensive practice&mdash;and that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bob,&rdquo; said Mr. Ben Allen, laying down his knife and fork,
and fixing his eyes on the visage of his friend: &ldquo;Bob, I&rsquo;ll tell you
what it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Bob Sawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must make yourself, with as little delay as possible, master
of Arabella&rsquo;s one thousand pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three per cent. consolidated Bank annuities, now standing in
her name in the book or books of the Governor and Company of
the Bank of England,&rdquo; added Bob Sawyer, in legal phraseology.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly so,&rdquo; said Ben. &ldquo;She has it when she comes of age, or
marries. She wants a year of coming of age, and if you plucked
up a spirit she needn&rsquo;t want a month of being married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a very charming and delightful creature,&rdquo; quoth Mr.
Robert Sawyer, in reply; &ldquo;and has only one fault that I know of,
Ben. It happens, unfortunately, that that single blemish is a want
of taste. She don&rsquo;t like me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my opinion that she don&rsquo;t know what she does like,&rdquo;
said Mr. Ben Allen, contemptuously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Bob Sawyer. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s my
opinion that she does know what she doesn&rsquo;t like, and that&rsquo;s of
more importance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; said Mr. Ben Allen, setting his teeth together, and
speaking more like a savage warrior who fed on raw wolf&rsquo;s flesh
which he carved with his fingers, than a peaceable young gentleman
who ate minced veal with a knife and fork, &ldquo;I wish I knew whether
any rascal really has been tampering with her, and attempting to
engage her affections. I think I should assassinate him, Bob.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d put a bullet in him, if I found him out,&rdquo; said Mr. Sawyer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
stopping in the course of a long draught of beer, and looking
malignantly out of the porter pot. &ldquo;If that didn&rsquo;t do his business,
I&rsquo;d extract it afterwards, and kill him that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Benjamin Allen gazed abstractedly on his friend for some
minutes in silence, and then said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have never proposed to her, point-blank, Bob?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Because I saw it would be of no use,&rdquo; replied Mr. Robert
Sawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall do it, before you are twenty-four hours older,&rdquo;
retorted Ben, with desperate calmness. &ldquo;She <em>shall</em> have you, or
I&rsquo;ll know the reason why. I&rsquo;ll exert my authority.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Bob Sawyer, &ldquo;we shall see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We <em>shall</em> see, my friend,&rdquo; replied Mr. Ben Allen fiercely. He
paused for a few seconds, and added in a voice broken by emotion,
&ldquo;You have loved her from a child, my friend. You loved her when
we were boys at school together, and, even then, she was wayward,
and slighted your young feelings. Do you recollect, with all the
eagerness of a child&rsquo;s love, one day pressing upon her acceptance
two small caraway-seed biscuits and one sweet apple, neatly folded
into a circular parcel with the leaf of a copybook?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; replied Bob Sawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She slighted that, I think?&rdquo; said Ben Allen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She did,&rdquo; rejoined Bob. &ldquo;She said I had kept the parcel so
long in the pockets of my corduroys that the apple was unpleasantly
warm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; said Mr. Allen, gloomily. &ldquo;Upon which we
ate it ourselves, in alternate bites.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bob Sawyer intimated his recollection of the circumstance last
alluded to, by a melancholy frown; and the two friends remained
for some time absorbed, each in his own meditations.</p>

<p>While these observations were being exchanged between Mr.
Bob Sawyer and Mr. Benjamin Allen; and while the boy in the
grey livery, marvelling at the unwonted prolongation of the dinner,
cast an anxious look, from time to time, towards the glass door, distracted
by inward misgivings regarding the amount of minced
veal which would be ultimately reserved for his individual cravings;
there rolled soberly on through the streets of Bristol, a private fly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
painted of a sad green colour, drawn by a chubby sort of brown
horse, and driven by a surly-looking man with his legs dressed like
the legs of a groom, and his body attired in the coat of a coachman.
Such appearances are common to many vehicles belonging
to, and maintained by, old ladies of economic habits; and in this
vehicle sat an old lady who was its mistress and proprietor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Martin!&rdquo; said the old lady, calling to the surly man, out of
the front window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said the surly man, touching his hat to the old lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Sawyer&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said the old lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was going there,&rdquo; said the surly man.</p>

<p>The old lady nodded the satisfaction which this proof of the
surly man&rsquo;s foresight imparted to her feelings; and the surly man
giving a smart lash to the chubby horse, they all repaired to Mr.
Bob Sawyer&rsquo;s together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Martin!&rdquo; said the old lady, when the fly stopped at the door
of Mr. Robert Sawyer late Nockemorf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Martin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask the lad to step out and mind the horse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to mind the horse myself,&rdquo; said Martin, laying his
whip on the roof of the fly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t permit it on any account,&rdquo; said the old lady; &ldquo;your
testimony will be very important, and I must take you into the
house with me. You must not stir from my side during the
whole interview. Do you hear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear,&rdquo; replied Martin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well; what are you stopping for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; replied Martin. So saying, the surly man leisurely
descended from the wheel, on which he had been poising himself on
the tips of the toes of his right foot, and having summoned the
boy in the grey livery, opened the coach-door, flung down the steps,
and thrusting in a hand enveloped in a dark wash-leather glove,
pulled out the old lady with as much concern in his manner as
if she were a bandbox.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; exclaimed the old lady. &ldquo;I am so flurried, now I
have got here, Martin, that I&rsquo;m all in a tremble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Martin coughed behind the dark wash-leather glove, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
expressed no sympathy; so the old lady, composing herself, trotted
up Mr. Bob Sawyer&rsquo;s steps, and Mr. Martin followed. Immediately
on the old lady&rsquo;s entering the shop, Mr. Benjamin Allen and Mr.
Bob Sawyer, who had been putting the spirits and water out of
sight, and upsetting nauseous drugs to take off the smell of the
tobacco-smoke, issued hastily forth in a transport of pleasure and
affection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear aunt,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Ben Allen, &ldquo;how kind of you
to look in upon us! Mr. Sawyer, aunt; my friend Mr. Bob
Sawyer whom I have spoken to you about, regarding&mdash;you know,
aunt.&rdquo; And here Mr. Ben Allen, who was not at the moment
extraordinarily sober, added the word &ldquo;Arabella,&rdquo; in what was
meant to be a whisper, but which was an especially audible and
distinct tone of speech, which nobody could avoid hearing, if anybody
were so disposed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Benjamin,&rdquo; said the old lady, struggling with a great
shortness of breath, and trembling from head to foot: &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be
alarmed, my dear, but I think I had better speak to Mr. Sawyer
alone for a moment. Only for one moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bob,&rdquo; said Mr. Allen, &ldquo;will you take my aunt into the
surgery?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; responded Bob, in a most professional voice. &ldquo;Step
this way, my dear ma&rsquo;am. Don&rsquo;t be frightened, ma&rsquo;am. We shall
be able to set you to rights in a very short time, I have no doubt,
ma&rsquo;am. Here, my dear ma&rsquo;am. Now then!&rdquo; With this, Mr.
Bob Sawyer, having handed the old lady to a chair, shut the door,
drew another chair close to her, and waited to hear detailed the
symptoms of some disorder from which he saw in perspective a
long train of profits and advantages.</p>

<p>The first thing the old lady did, was to shake her head a great
many times and begin to cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nervous,&rdquo; said Bob Sawyer, complacently. &ldquo;Camphor-julep
and water three times a day, and composing draught at night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to begin, Mr. Sawyer,&rdquo; said the old lady.
&ldquo;It is so very painful and distressing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need not begin, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Bob Sawyer. &ldquo;I
can anticipate all you would say. The head is in fault.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I should be very sorry to think it was the heart,&rdquo; said the old
lady, with a slight groan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not the slightest danger of that, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied Bob Sawyer.
&ldquo;The stomach is the primary cause.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Sawyer!&rdquo; exclaimed the old lady, starting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not the least doubt of it, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; rejoined Bob, looking
wondrous wise. &ldquo;Medicine, in time, my dear ma&rsquo;am, would have
prevented it all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Sawyer,&rdquo; said the old lady, more flurried than before,
&ldquo;this conduct is either great impertinence to one in my situation
sir, or it arises from your not understanding the object of my visit.
If it had been in the power of medicine, or any foresight I could
have used, to prevent what has occurred, I should certainly have
done so. I had better see my nephew at once,&rdquo; said the old lady,
twirling her reticule indignantly, and rising as she spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop a moment, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Bob Sawyer; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I
have not understood you. What <em>is</em> the matter, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My niece, Mr. Sawyer,&rdquo; said the old lady: &ldquo;your friend&rsquo;s
sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Bob, all impatience; for the old lady,
although much agitated, spoke with the most tantalising deliberation,
as old ladies often do. &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Left my home, Mr. Sawyer, three days ago, on a pretended
visit to my sister, another aunt of hers, who keeps the large
boarding-school just beyond the third mile-stone where there is a
very large laburnum tree and an oak gate,&rdquo; said the old lady,
stopping in this place to dry her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, devil take the laburnum tree! ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Bob, quite
forgetting his professional dignity in his anxiety. &ldquo;Get on a little
faster; put a little more steam on, ma&rsquo;am, pray.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This morning,&rdquo; said the old lady, slowly, &ldquo;this morning
<span class="nobreak">she&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She came back, ma&rsquo;am, I suppose,&rdquo; said Bob, with great
animation. &ldquo;Did she come back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, she did not; she wrote,&rdquo; replied the old lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did she say?&rdquo; inquired Bob, eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She said, Mr. Sawyer,&rdquo; replied the old lady,&mdash;&ldquo;and it is this I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
want you to prepare Benjamin&rsquo;s mind for, gently and by degrees;
she said that she was&mdash;I have got the letter in my pocket, Mr.
Sawyer, but my glasses are in the carriage, and I should only waste
your time if I attempted to point out the passage to you, without
them; she said, in short, Mr. Sawyer, that she was married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said, or rather shouted, Mr. Bob Sawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Married,&rdquo; repeated the old lady.</p>

<p>Mr. Bob Sawyer stopped to hear no more; but darting from the
surgery into the outer shop, cried in a stentorian voice, &ldquo;Ben, my
boy, she&rsquo;s bolted!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Ben Allen, who had been slumbering behind the counter,
with his head half a foot or so below his knees, no sooner heard
this appalling communication, than he made a precipitate rush at
Mr. Martin, and, twisting his hand in the neckcloth of that taciturn
servitor, expressed an intention of choking him where he stood.
This intention, with a promptitude often the effect of desperation,
he at once commenced carrying into execution, with much vigour
and surgical skill.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin, who was a man of few words and possessed but little
power of eloquence or persuasion, submitted to this operation with
a very calm and agreeable expression of countenance, for some
seconds; finding, however, that it threatened speedily to lead to a
result, which would place it beyond his power to claim any wages,
board or otherwise, in all time to come, he muttered an inarticulate
remonstrance and felled Mr. Benjamin Allen to the ground. As
that gentleman had his hands entangled in his cravat, he had no
alternative but to follow him to the floor. There they both lay
struggling, when the shop door opened, and the party was increased
by the arrival of two most unexpected visitors; to wit, Mr. Pickwick
and Mr. Samuel Weller.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="color09"></a>
<img src="images/color09.jpg" width="624" height="462" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>He felled Mr. Benjamin Allen
to the ground</p>
</div></div>

<p>The impression at once produced on Mr. Weller&rsquo;s mind by what
he saw, was, that Mr. Martin was hired by the establishment of
Sawyer late Nockemorf, to take strong medicine, or to go into fits
and be experimentalised upon, or to swallow poison now and then
with the view of testing the efficacy of some new antidotes, or to do
something or other to promote the great science of medicine, and
gratify the ardent spirit of inquiry burning in the bosoms of its two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
young professors. So without presuming to interfere, Sam stood
perfectly still, and looked on, as if he were mightily interested in
the result of the then pending experiment. Not so Mr. Pickwick.
He at once threw himself on the astonished combatants, with
his accustomed energy, and loudly called upon the bystanders to
interpose.</p>

<p>This roused Mr. Bob Sawyer, who had been hitherto quite
paralysed by the frenzy of his companion. With that gentleman&rsquo;s
assistance, Mr. Pickwick raised Ben Allen to his feet. Mr. Martin,
finding himself alone on the floor, got up, and looked about him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Allen,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;what is the matter, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, sir!&rdquo; replied Mr. Allen, with haughty defiance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick, looking at Bob Sawyer.
&ldquo;Is he unwell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before Bob could reply, Mr. Ben Allen seized Mr. Pickwick by
the hand, and murmured in sorrowful accents, &ldquo;My sister, my
dear sir; my sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, is that all?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;We shall easily
arrange that matter, I hope. Your sister is safe and well, and I
am here, my dear sir, <span class="nobreak">to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry to do anythin&rsquo; as may cause an interruption to such wery
pleasant proceedin&rsquo;s, as the king said ven he dissolved the parliament,&rdquo;
interposed Mr. Weller, who had been peeping through the
glass door; &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s another experiment here, sir. Here&rsquo;s a
wenerable old lady a lyin&rsquo; on the carpet waiting for dissection, or
galwinism, or some other rewivin&rsquo; and scientific inwention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I forgot,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Ben Allen. &ldquo;It is my aunt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;Poor lady! Gently, Sam,
gently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strange sitivation for one o&rsquo; the family,&rdquo; observed Sam Weller,
hoisting the aunt into a chair. &ldquo;Now, depitty Sawbones, bring
out the wollatilly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The latter observation was addressed to the boy in grey, who,
having handed over the fly to the care of the street-keeper, had
come back to see what all the noise was about. Between the boy
in grey, and Mr. Bob Sawyer, and Mr. Benjamin Allen (who having
frightened his aunt into a fainting fit, was affectionately solicitous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
for her recovery), the old lady was, at length, restored to consciousness;
then Mr. Ben Allen, turning with a puzzled countenance to
Mr. Pickwick, asked him what he was about to say, when he had
been so alarmingly interrupted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are all friends here, I presume?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick,
clearing his voice, and looking towards the man of few words
with the surly countenance who drove the fly with the chubby
horse.</p>

<p>This reminded Mr. Bob Sawyer that the boy in grey was looking
on, with eyes wide open, and greedy ears. The incipient chemist
having been lifted up by his coat collar, and dropped outside the
door, Bob Sawyer assured Mr. Pickwick that he might speak without
reserve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your sister, my dear sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, turning to
Benjamin Allen, &ldquo;is in London; well and happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her happiness is no object to me, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Benjamin
Allen, with a flourish of the hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her husband <em>is</em> an object to <em>me</em>, sir,&rdquo; said Bob Sawyer. &ldquo;He
shall be an object to me sir, at twelve paces, and a very pretty
object I&rsquo;ll make of him, sir&mdash;a mean-spirited scoundrel!&rdquo; This, as
it stood, was a very pretty denunciation, and magnanimous withal;
but Mr. Bob Sawyer rather weakened its effect, by winding up
with some general observations concerning the punching of heads
and knocking out of eyes, which were commonplace by comparison.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &ldquo;before you apply those
epithets to the gentleman in question, consider, dispassionately, the
extent of his fault, and above all remember that he is a friend
of mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Mr. Bob Sawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His name!&rdquo; cried Ben Allen. &ldquo;His name!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Nathaniel Winkle,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>Mr. Benjamin Allen deliberately crushed his spectacles beneath
the heel of his boot, and having picked up the pieces, and put
them into three separate pockets, folded his arms, bit his lips, and
looked in a threatening manner at the bland features of Mr.
Pickwick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s you, is it, sir, who have encouraged and brought
about this match?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Benjamin Allen at length.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s this gentleman&rsquo;s servant, I suppose,&rdquo; interrupted
the old lady, &ldquo;who has been skulking about my house, and endeavouring
to entrap my servants to conspire against their mistress.
Martin!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said the surly man, coming forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that the young man you saw in the lane, whom you told
me about, this morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Martin, who, as it has already appeared, was a man of few
words, looked at Sam Weller, nodded his head, and growled forth,
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the man!&rdquo; Mr. Weller, who was never proud, gave a
smile of friendly recognition as his eyes encountered those of the
surly groom, and admitted, in courteous terms, that he had
&ldquo;knowed him afore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And this is the faithful creature,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Ben Allen,
&ldquo;whom I had nearly suffocated! Mr. Pickwick, how dare you
allow your fellow to be employed in the abduction of my sister?
I demand that you explain this matter, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Explain it, sir!&rdquo; cried Mr. Bob Sawyer, fiercely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a conspiracy,&rdquo; said Ben Allen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A regular plant,&rdquo; added Mr. Bob Sawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A disgraceful imposition,&rdquo; observed the old lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing but a do,&rdquo; remarked Martin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray hear me,&rdquo; urged Mr. Pickwick, as Mr. Ben Allen fell into
a chair that patients were bled in, and gave way to his pocket-handkerchief.
&ldquo;I have rendered no assistance in this matter,
beyond that of being present at one interview between the young
people, which I could not prevent, and from which I conceived my
presence would remove any slight colouring of impropriety that it
might otherwise have had; this is the whole share I have taken in
the transaction, and I had no suspicion that an immediate marriage
was even contemplated. Though mind,&rdquo; added Mr. Pickwick,
hastily checking himself, &ldquo;mind I do not say I should have prevented
it, if I <em>had</em> known that it was intended.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You hear that, all of you; you hear that?&rdquo; said Mr. Benjamin
Allen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope they do,&rdquo; mildly observed Mr. Pickwick, looking round,
&ldquo;and,&rdquo; added that gentleman: his colour mounting as he spoke:
&ldquo;I hope they hear this, sir, also. That from what has been stated
to me, sir, I assert that you were by no means justified in attempting
to force your sister&rsquo;s inclinations as you did, and that you should
rather have endeavoured by your kindness and forbearance to have
supplied the place of other nearer relations whom she has never
known, from a child. As regards my young friend, I must beg to
add, that in every point of worldly advantage, he is, at least,
on an equal footing with yourself, if not on a much better one,
and that unless I hear this question discussed with becoming
temper and moderation, I decline hearing any more said upon
the subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to make a wery few remarks in addition to wot has been
put forard by the honourable gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n as has jist give over,&rdquo; said
Mr. Weller, stepping forth, &ldquo;which is this here: a indiwidual in
company has called me a feller.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That has nothing whatever to do with the matter, Sam,&rdquo;
interposed Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;Pray hold your tongue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a goin&rsquo; to say nothin&rsquo; on that ere pint, sir,&rdquo; replied
Sam, &ldquo;but merely this here. P&rsquo;raps that gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n may think as
there wos a priory &rsquo;tachment; but there worn&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the sort,
for the young lady said, in the wery beginnin&rsquo; o&rsquo; keepin&rsquo; company,
that she couldn&rsquo;t abide him. Nobody&rsquo;s cut him out, and it
&rsquo;ud ha&rsquo; been jist the wery same for him if the young lady had
never seen Mr. Vinkle. That&rsquo;s wot I wished to say, sir, and
I hope I&rsquo;ve now made that &rsquo;ere gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n&rsquo;s mind easy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A short pause followed these consolatory remarks of Mr. Weller.
Then Mr. Ben Allen, rising from his chair, protested that he
would never see Arabella&rsquo;s face again: while Mr. Bob Sawyer,
despite Sam&rsquo;s flattering assurance, vowed dreadful vengeance on
the happy bridegroom.</p>

<p>But, just when matters were at their height, and threatening to
remain so, Mr. Pickwick found a powerful assistant in the old lady,
who, evidently much struck by the mode in which he had advocated
her niece&rsquo;s cause, ventured to approach Mr. Benjamin Allen with a
few comforting reflections, of which the chief were, that after all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
perhaps, it was well it was no worse; the least said the soonest
mended, and upon her word she did not know that it was so very
bad after all; what was over couldn&rsquo;t be begun, and what couldn&rsquo;t
be cured must be endured: with various other assurances of the
like novel and strengthening description. To all of these, Mr.
Benjamin Allen replied that he meant no disrespect to his aunt, or
anybody there, but if it were all the same to them, and they would
allow him to have his own way, he would rather have the pleasure
of hating his sister till death, and after it.</p>

<p>At length, when this determination had been announced half a
hundred times, the old lady, suddenly bridling up and looking very
majestic, wished to know what she had done that no respect was to
be paid to her years or station, and that she should be obliged to
beg and pray, in that way, of her own nephew, whom she remembered
about five-and-twenty years before he was born, and whom
she had known personally, when he hadn&rsquo;t a tooth in his head?
To say nothing of her presence on the first occasion of his having
his hair cut, and assistance at numerous other times and ceremonies
during his babyhood, of sufficient importance to found a claim upon
his affection, obedience, and sympathies, for ever.</p>

<p>While the good lady was bestowing this objurgation on Mr. Ben
Allen, Bob Sawyer and Mr. Pickwick had retired in close conversation
to the inner room, where Mr. Sawyer was observed to
apply himself several times to the mouth of a black bottle, under
the influence of which, his features gradually assumed a cheerful,
and even jovial expression. And at last he emerged from the room,
bottle in hand, and, remarking that he was very sorry to say he had
been making a fool of himself, begged to propose the health and
happiness of Mr. and Mrs. Winkle, whose felicity, so far from envying,
he would be the first to congratulate them upon. Hearing
this, Mr. Ben Allen suddenly arose from his chair, and, seizing
the black bottle, drank the toast so heartily, that, the liquor
being strong, he nearly became as black in the face as the bottle.
Finally, the black bottle went round till it was empty, and
there was so much shaking of hands and interchanging of compliments,
that even the metal-visaged Mr. Martin condescended to
smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Bob Sawyer, rubbing his hands, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have
a jolly night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;that I must return to my
inn. I have not been accustomed to fatigue lately, and my journey
has tired me exceedingly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll take some tea, Mr. Pickwick?&rdquo; said the old lady, with
irresistible sweetness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, I would rather not,&rdquo; replied that gentleman.
The truth is, that the old lady&rsquo;s evidently increasing admiration
was Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s principal inducement for going away. He
thought of Mrs. Bardell; and every glance of the old lady&rsquo;s eyes
threw him into a cold perspiration.</p>

<p>As Mr. Pickwick could by no means be prevailed upon to stay,
it was arranged at once, on his own proposition, that Mr. Benjamin
Allen should accompany him on his journey to the elder Mr.
Winkle&rsquo;s, and that the coach should be at the door at nine o&rsquo;clock
next morning. He then took his leave, and, followed by Samuel
Weller, repaired to the Bush. It is worthy of remark, that Mr.
Martin&rsquo;s face was horribly convulsed as he shook hands with Sam
at parting, and that he gave vent to a smile and an oath simultaneously:
from which tokens it has been inferred by those who
were best acquainted with that gentleman&rsquo;s peculiarities, that he
expressed himself much pleased with Mr. Weller&rsquo;s society, and
requested the honour of his further acquaintance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I order a private room, sir?&rdquo; inquired Sam, when they
reached the Bush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, no, Sam,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick; &ldquo;as I dined in the
coffee-room, and shall go to bed soon, it is hardly worth while. See
who there is in the travellers&rsquo; room, Sam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Weller departed on his errand, and presently returned to
say, there was only a gentleman with one eye; and that he and the
landlord were drinking a bowl of bishop together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will join them,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a queer customer, the vun-eyed vun, sir,&rdquo; observed Mr.
Weller, as he led the way. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a gammonin&rsquo; that &rsquo;ere landlord,
he is, sir, till he don&rsquo;t rightly know vether he&rsquo;s a standing on the
soles of his boots or the crown of his hat.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>The individual to whom this observation referred, was sitting at
the upper end of the room when Mr. Pickwick entered, and was
smoking a large Dutch pipe, with his eye intently fixed on the
round face of the landlord: a jolly-looking old personage, to whom
he had recently been relating some tale of wonder, as was testified
by sundry disjointed exclamations of, &ldquo;Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t have
believed it! The strangest thing I ever heard! Couldn&rsquo;t have
supposed it possible!&rdquo; and other expressions of astonishment which
burst spontaneously from his lips, as he returned the fixed gaze
of the one-eyed man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Servant, sir,&rdquo; said the one-eyed man to Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;Fine
night, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very much so indeed,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, as the waiter
placed a small decanter of brandy and some hot water before him.</p>

<p>While Mr. Pickwick was mixing his brandy and water, the one-eyed
man looked round at him earnestly, from time to time, and at
length said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve seen you before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t recollect you,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I daresay not,&rdquo; said the one-eyed man. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know
me, but I knew two friends of yours that were stopping at the
Peacock at Eatanswill, at the time of the Election.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; rejoined the one-eyed man. &ldquo;I mentioned a little circumstance
to them about a friend of mine of the name of Tom
Smart. Perhaps you have heard them speaking of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Often,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Pickwick, smiling. &ldquo;He was your uncle,
I think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no; only a friend of my uncle&rsquo;s,&rdquo; replied the one-eyed
man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was a wonderful man, that uncle of yours, though,&rdquo; remarked
the landlord, shaking his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I think he was, I think I may say he was,&rdquo; answered the
one-eyed man. &ldquo;I could tell you a story about that same uncle,
gentlemen, that would rather surprise you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could you?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;Let us hear it, by all
means.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>The one-eyed bagman ladled out a glass of negus from the bowl,
and drank it; smoked a long whiff out of the Dutch pipe; and
then, calling to Sam Weller, who was lingering near the door, that
he needn&rsquo;t go away, unless he wanted to, because the story was no
secret, fixed his eye upon the landlord&rsquo;s and proceeded, in the words
of the next chapter.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;My</span> uncle, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the bagman, &ldquo;was
one of the merriest, pleasantest, cleverest
fellows that ever lived. I wish you had
known him, gentlemen. On second thoughts,
gentlemen, I <em>don&rsquo;t</em> wish you had known him,
for if you had, you would have been all, by
this time, in the ordinary course of nature, if not dead, at all
events so near it, as to have taken to stopping at home and
giving up company: which would have deprived me of the
inestimable pleasure of addressing you at this moment. Gentlemen,
I wish your fathers and mothers had known my uncle. They
would have been amazingly fond of him, especially your respectable
mothers; I know they would. If any two of his numerous virtues
predominated over the many that adorned his character, I should
say they were his mixed punch and his after-supper song. Excuse
my dwelling on these melancholy reflections of departed worth;
you won&rsquo;t see a man like my uncle every day in the week.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have always considered it a great point in my uncle&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
character, gentlemen, that he was the intimate friend and companion
of Tom Smart, of the great house of Bilson and Slum,
Cateaton Street, City. My uncle collected for Tiggin and Welps,
but for a long time he went pretty near the same journey as Tom;
and the very first night they met, my uncle took a fancy for Tom,
and Tom took a fancy for my uncle. They made a bet of a new
hat before they had known each other half an hour, who should
brew the best quart of punch and drink it the quickest. My uncle
was judged to have won the making, but Tom Smart beat him in
the drinking by about half a salt-spoonful. They took another
quart a-piece to drink each other&rsquo;s health in, and were staunch
friends ever afterwards. There&rsquo;s a destiny in these things, gentlemen:
we can&rsquo;t help it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In personal appearance, my uncle was a trifle shorter than the
middle size; he was a thought stouter, too, than the ordinary run
of people, and perhaps his face might be a shade redder. He had
the jolliest face you ever saw, gentlemen: something like Punch,
with a handsomer nose and chin; his eyes were always twinkling
and sparkling with good humour; and a smile&mdash;not one of your
unmeaning wooden grins, but a real, merry, hearty, good-tempered
smile&mdash;was perpetually on his countenance. He was pitched out
of his gig once, and knocked, head first, against a mile-stone.
There he lay, stunned, and so cut about the face with some gravel
which had been heaped up alongside it, that, to use my uncle&rsquo;s own
strong expression, if his mother could have revisited the earth, she
wouldn&rsquo;t have known him. Indeed, when I come to think of the
matter, gentlemen, I feel pretty sure she wouldn&rsquo;t, for she died
when my uncle was two years and seven months old, and I think
it&rsquo;s very likely that, even without the gravel, his top-boots would
have puzzled the good lady not a little: to say nothing of his jolly
red face. However, there he lay, and I have heard my uncle say
many a time, that the man said who picked him up that he was
smiling as merrily as if he had tumbled out for a treat, and that
after they had bled him, the first glimmerings of returning
animation were, his jumping up in bed, bursting out into a loud
laugh, kissing the young woman who held the basin, and demanding
a mutton chop and a pickled walnut. He was very fond of pickled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
walnuts, gentlemen. He said he always found that, taken without
vinegar, they relished the beer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My uncle&rsquo;s great journey was in the fall of the leaf, at which
time he collected debts, and took orders, in the north: going from
London to Edinburgh, from Edinburgh to Glasgow, from Glasgow
back to Edinburgh, and thence to London by the smack. You are
to understand that his second visit to Edinburgh was for his own
pleasure. He used to go back for a week, just to look up his old
friends; and what with breakfasting with this one, lunching with
that, dining with a third, and supping with another, a pretty tight
week he used to make of it. I don&rsquo;t know whether any of you,
gentlemen, ever partook of a real, substantial, hospitable Scotch
breakfast, and then went to a slight lunch of a bushel of oysters,
a dozen or so of bottled ale, and a noggin or two of whisky to
close up with. If you ever did, you will agree with me that it
requires a pretty strong head to go out to dinner and supper
afterwards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, bless your hearts and eyebrows, all this sort of thing was
nothing to my uncle! He was so well seasoned that it was mere
child&rsquo;s play. I have heard him say that he could see the Dundee
people out, any day, and walk home afterwards without staggering;
and yet the Dundee people have as strong heads and as strong
punch, gentleman, as you are likely to meet with, between the
poles. I have heard of a Glasgow man and a Dundee man drinking
against each other for fifteen hours at a sitting. They were both
suffocated, as nearly as could be ascertained, at the same moment,
but with this trifling exception, gentlemen, they were not a bit
the worse for it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One night, within four-and-twenty hours of the time when
he had settled to take shipping for London, my uncle supped
at the house of a very old friend of his, a Bailie Mac something
and four syllables after it, who lived in the old town of Edinburgh.
There were the bailie&rsquo;s wife, and the bailie&rsquo;s three daughters,
and the bailie&rsquo;s grown-up son, and three or four stout, bushy
eye-browed, canny old Scotch fellows, that the bailie had got
together to do honour to my uncle, and help to make merry. It
was a glorious supper. There were kippered salmon, and Finnan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
haddocks, and a lamb&rsquo;s head, and a haggis&mdash;a celebrated Scotch
dish, gentlemen, which my uncle used to say always looked to him,
when it came to the table, very much like a cupid&rsquo;s stomach&mdash;and
a great many other things besides, that I forget the names of, but
very good things notwithstanding. The lassies were pretty and
agreeable; the bailie&rsquo;s wife was one of the best creatures that ever
lived; and my uncle was in thoroughly good cue. The consequence
of which was, that the young ladies tittered and giggled,
and the old lady laughed out loud, and the bailie and the other
old fellows roared till they were red in the face, the whole mortal
time. I don&rsquo;t quite recollect how many tumblers of whisky toddy
each man drank after supper; but this I know, that about one
o&rsquo;clock in the morning, the bailie&rsquo;s grown-up son became insensible
while attempting the first verse of &lsquo;Willie brewed a peak o&rsquo; maut;&rsquo;
and he having been, for half an hour before, the only other man
visible above the mahogany, it occurred to my uncle that it was
almost time to think about going: especially as drinking had set
in at seven o&rsquo;clock: in order that he might get home at a decent
hour. But, thinking it might not be quite polite to go just then,
my uncle voted himself into the chair, mixed another glass, rose to
propose his own health, addressed himself in a neat and complimentary
speech, and drank the toast with great enthusiasm. Still
nobody woke; so my uncle took a little drop more&mdash;neat this
time, to prevent the toddy from disagreeing with him&mdash;and,
laying violent hands on his hat, sallied forth into the street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a wild, gusty night when my uncle closed the bailie&rsquo;s
door, and settling his hat firmly on his head to prevent the wind
from taking it, thrust his hands into his pockets, and looking upward,
took a short survey of the state of the weather. The clouds
were drifting over the moon at their giddiest speed: at one time
wholly obscuring her: at another, suffering her to burst forth in
full splendour and shed her light on all the subjects around: anon,
driving over her again, with increased velocity, and shrouding
everything in darkness. &lsquo;Really, this won&rsquo;t do,&rsquo; said my uncle,
addressing himself to the weather, as if he felt himself personally
offended. &lsquo;This is not at all the kind of thing for my voyage. It
will not do, at any price,&rsquo; said my uncle very impressively. Having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
repeated this, several times, he recovered his balance with some
difficulty&mdash;for he was rather giddy with looking up into the sky so
long&mdash;and walked merrily on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bailie&rsquo;s house was in the Canongate, and my uncle was
going to the other end of Leith Walk, rather better than a mile&rsquo;s
journey. On either side of him, there shot up against the dark
sky, tall, gaunt, straggling houses, with time-stained fronts, and
windows that seemed to have shared the lot of eyes in mortals, and
to have grown dim and sunken with age. Six, seven, eight storeys
high, were the houses; storey piled above storey, as the children build
with cards&mdash;throwing their dark shadows over the roughly paved
road, and making the dark night darker. A few oil lamps were
scattered at long distances, but they only served to mark the dirty
entrance to some narrow close, or to show where a common stair
communicated, by steep and intricate windings, with the various
flats above. Glancing at all these things with the air of a man who
had seen them too often before, to think them worthy of much
notice now, my uncle walked up the middle of the street, with a
thumb in each waistcoat pocket, indulging from time to time in
various snatches of song, chanted forth with such good will and
spirit, that the quiet honest folk started from their first sleep and lay
trembling in bed till the sound died away in the distance; when,
satisfying themselves that it was only some drunken ne&rsquo;er-do-weel
finding his way home, they covered themselves up warm and fell
asleep again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am particular in describing how my uncle walked up the
middle of the street, with his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets,
gentlemen, because, as he often used to say (and with great reason
too), there is nothing at all extraordinary in this story, unless you
distinctly understand at the beginning that he was not by any means
of a marvellous or romantic turn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, my uncle walked on with his thumbs in his waistcoat
pockets, taking the middle of the street to himself, and singing,
now a verse of a love-song, and then a verse of a drinking one, and
when he was tired of both, whistling melodiously, until he reached
the North Bridge, which, at this point, connects the old and new
towns of Edinburgh. Here he stopped for a minute, to look at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
strange irregular clusters of lights piled one above the other, and
twinkling afar off so high, that they looked like stars, gleaming
from the castle walls on the one side and the Calton Hill on the
other, as if they illuminated veritable castles in the air; while the
old picturesque town slept heavily on, in gloom and darkness,
below: its palace and chapel of Holyrood, guarded day and night,
as a friend of my uncle&rsquo;s used to say, by old Arthur&rsquo;s Seat,
towering, surly and dark, like some gruff genius, over the ancient
city he has watched so long. I say, gentlemen, my uncle stopped
here, for a minute, to look about him; and then, paying a compliment
to the weather, which had a little cleared up, though the
moon was sinking, walked on again, as royally as before; keeping
the middle of the road with great dignity, and looking as if he
would very much like to meet somebody who would dispute possession
of it with him. There was nobody at all disposed to
contest the point, as it happened; and so, on he went, with his
thumbs in his waistcoat pockets, like a lamb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When my uncle reached the end of Leith Walk, he had to
cross a pretty large piece of waste ground which separated him from
a short street which he had to turn down, to go direct to his lodging.
Now, in this piece of waste ground, there was, at that time, an
enclosure belonging to some wheelwright who contracted with the
Post-office for the purchase of old worn-out mail coaches; and my
uncle, being very fond of coaches, old, young, or middle-aged, all at
once took it into his head to step out of his road for no other
purpose than to peep between the palings at these mails&mdash;about a
dozen of which he remembered to have seen, crowded together in
a very forlorn and dismantled state, inside. My uncle was a very
enthusiastic, emphatic sort of person, gentlemen; so, finding that
he could not obtain a good peep between the palings, he got over
them, and sitting himself quietly down on an old axletree, began
to contemplate the mail coaches with a great deal of gravity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There might be a dozen of them, or there might be more&mdash;my
uncle was never quite certain on this point, and being a man
of very scrupulous veracity about numbers, didn&rsquo;t like to say&mdash;but
there they stood, all huddled together in the most desolate condition
imaginable. The doors had been torn from their hinges and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
removed; the linings had been stripped off: only a shred hanging
here and there by a rusty nail; the lamps were gone, the poles had
long since vanished, the iron-work was rusty, the paint was worn
away; the wind whistled through the chinks in the bare wood-work;
and the rain, which had collected on the roofs, fell, drop by
drop, into the insides with a hollow and melancholy sound. They
were the decaying skeletons of departed mails, and in that lonely
place, at that time of night, they looked chill and dismal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My uncle rested his head upon his hands, and thought of the
busy bustling people who had rattled about, years before, in the
old coaches, and were now as silent and changed; he thought of
the numbers of people to whom one of those crazy, mouldering
vehicles had borne, night after night, for many years, and through
all weathers, the anxiously expected intelligence, the eagerly
looked-for remittance, the promised assurance of health and safety,
the sudden announcement of sickness and death. The merchant,
the lover, the wife, the widow, the mother, the schoolboy, the very
child who tottered to the door at the postman&rsquo;s knock&mdash;how had
they all looked forward to the arrival of the old coach. And where
were they all now!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, my uncle used to <em>say</em> that he thought all this at
the time, but I rather suspect he learnt it out of some book afterwards,
for he distinctly stated that he fell into a kind of doze, as he
sat on the old axletree looking at the decayed mail coaches, and
that he was suddenly awakened by some deep church-bell striking
two. Now, my uncle was never a fast thinker, and if he had
thought all these things, I am quite certain it would have taken
him till full half-past two o&rsquo;clock, at the very least. I am, therefore,
decidedly of opinion, gentlemen, that my uncle fell into a
kind of doze, without having thought about anything at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be this as it may, a church bell struck two. My uncle woke,
rubbed his eyes, and jumped up in astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In one instant after the clock struck two, the whole of this
deserted and quiet spot had become a scene of most extraordinary
life and animation. The mail coach doors were on their hinges,
the lining was replaced, the iron-work was as good as new, the
paint was restored, the lamps were alight, cushions and great-coats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
were on every box, porters were thrusting parcels into every
boot, guards were stowing away letter-bags, hostlers were dashing
pails of water against the renovated wheels; numbers of men were
rushing about, fixing poles into every coach; passengers arrived,
portmanteaus were handed up, horses were put to; in short, it
was perfectly clear that every mail there was to be off directly.
Gentlemen, my uncle opened his eyes so wide at all this, that,
to the very last moment of his life, he used to wonder how it fell
out that he had ever been able to shut &rsquo;em again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now then!&rsquo; said a voice, as my uncle felt a hand on his
shoulder, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re booked for inside. You&rsquo;d better get in.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<em>I</em> booked!&rsquo; said my uncle, turning round.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, certainly.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My uncle, gentlemen, could say nothing; he was so very much
astonished. The queerest thing of all was, that although there was
such a crowd of persons, and although fresh faces were pouring in
every moment, there was no telling where they came from. They
seemed to start up, in some strange manner, from the ground, or
the air, and disappear in the same way. When a porter had put
his luggage in the coach, and received his fare, he turned round and
was gone; and before my uncle had well begun to wonder what
had become of him, half a dozen fresh ones started up, and staggered
along under the weight of parcels which seemed big enough
to crush them. The passengers were all dressed so oddly too!
Large, broad-skirted, laced coats with great cuffs and no collars;
and wigs, gentlemen&mdash;great formal wigs with a tie behind. My
uncle could make nothing of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now, <em>are</em> you going to get in?&rsquo; said the person who had
addressed my uncle before. He was dressed as a mail guard, with
a wig on his head and most enormous cuffs to his coat, and had a
lantern in one hand, and a huge blunderbuss in the other, which he
was going to stow away in his little arm-chest. &lsquo;<em>Are</em> you going to
get in, Jack Martin?&rsquo; said the guard, holding the lantern to my
uncle&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hallo!&rsquo; said my uncle, falling back a step or two. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s
familiar!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s so on the way-bill,&rsquo; replied the guard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t there a &ldquo;Mister&rdquo; before it?&rsquo; said my uncle. For he
felt, gentlemen, that for a guard he didn&rsquo;t know to call him Jack
Martin, was a liberty which the Post-office wouldn&rsquo;t have sanctioned
if they had known it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, there is not,&rsquo; rejoined the guard, coolly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is the fare paid?&rsquo; inquired my uncle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Of course it is,&rsquo; rejoined the guard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is, is it?&rsquo; said my uncle. &lsquo;Then here goes! Which
coach?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This,&rsquo; said the guard, pointing to an old-fashioned Edinburgh
and London Mail, which had the steps down, and the door open.
&lsquo;Stop! here are the other passengers. Let them get in first.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the guard spoke, there all at once appeared, right in front
of my uncle, a young gentleman in a powdered wig, and a sky-blue
coat trimmed with silver, made very full and broad in the skirts,
which were lined with buckram. Tiggin and Welps were in the
printed calico and waistcoatpiece line, gentlemen, so my uncle
knew all the materials at once. He wore knee breeches, and a
kind of leggings rolled up over his silk stockings, and shoes with
buckles; he had ruffles at his wrists, a three-cornered hat on his
head, and a long taper sword by his side. The flaps of his waistcoat
came half-way down his thighs, and the ends of his cravat reached
to his waist. He stalked gravely to the coach door, pulled off his
hat, and held it above his head at arm&rsquo;s length: cocking his little
finger in the air at the same time, as some affected people do, when
they take a cup of tea. Then he drew his feet together, and made
a low grave bow, and then put out his left hand. My uncle was
just going to step forward, and shake it heartily, when he perceived
that these attentions were directed, not towards him, but
to a young lady who had just then appeared at the foot of the
steps, attired in an old-fashioned green velvet dress with a long
waist and stomacher. She had no bonnet on her head, gentlemen,
which was muffled in a black silk hood, but she looked round for an
instant as she prepared to get into the coach, and such a beautiful
face as she disclosed, my uncle had never seen&mdash;not even in a
picture. She got into the coach, holding up her dress with one
hand; and, as my uncle always said, with a round oath, when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
told the story, he wouldn&rsquo;t have believed it possible that legs and
feet could have been brought to such a state of perfection unless he
had seen them with his own eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, in this one glimpse of the beautiful face, my uncle saw
that the young lady cast an imploring look upon him, and that
she appeared terrified and distressed. He noticed, too, that the
young fellow in the powdered wig, notwithstanding his show of
gallantry, which was all very fine and grand, clasped her tight by
the wrist when she got in, and followed himself immediately afterwards.
An uncommonly ill-looking fellow, in a close brown wig
and a plum-coloured suit, wearing a very large sword, and boots up
to his hips, belonged to the party; and when he sat himself down
next to the young lady, who shrunk into a corner at his approach,
my uncle was confirmed in his original impression that something
dark and mysterious was going forward, or, as he always said himself,
that &lsquo;there was a screw loose somewhere.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s quite surprising
how quickly he made up his mind to help the lady at any
peril, if she needed help.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Death and lightning!&rsquo; exclaimed the young gentleman,
laying his hand upon his sword as my uncle entered the coach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Blood and thunder!&rsquo; roared the other gentleman. With
this, he whipped his sword out, and made a lunge at my uncle
without further ceremony. My uncle had no weapon about him,
but with great dexterity he snatched the ill-looking gentleman&rsquo;s
three-cornered hat from his head, and, receiving the point of his
sword right through the crown, squeezed the sides together, and
held it tight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pink him behind!&rsquo; cried the ill-looking gentleman to his
companion, as he struggled to regain his sword.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He had better not,&rsquo; cried my uncle, displaying the heel of one
of his shoes, in a threatening manner, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll kick his brains out if he
has any, or fracture his skull if he hasn&rsquo;t.&rsquo; Exerting all his strength
at this moment, my uncle wrenched the ill-looking man&rsquo;s sword
from his grasp, and flung it clean out of the coach-window: upon
which the younger gentleman vociferated &lsquo;Death and lightning!&rsquo;
again, and laid his hand upon the hilt of his sword, in a very fierce
manner, but didn&rsquo;t draw it. Perhaps, gentlemen, as my uncle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
used to say with a smile, perhaps he was afraid of alarming the
lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now, gentlemen,&rsquo; said my uncle, taking his seat deliberately,
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to have any death, with or without lightning, in a
lady&rsquo;s presence, and we have had quite blood and thundering enough
for one journey; so, if you please, we&rsquo;ll sit in our places like quiet
insides. Here, guard, pick up that gentleman&rsquo;s carving-knife.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As quickly as my uncle said the words, the guard appeared at
the coach-window, with the gentleman&rsquo;s sword in his hand. He
held up his lantern, and looked earnestly in my uncle&rsquo;s face, as he
handed it in: when, by its light, my uncle saw, to his great surprise,
that an immense crowd of mail-coach guards swarmed round
the window, every one of whom had his eyes earnestly fixed upon
him too. He had never seen such a sea of white faces, red bodies,
and earnest eyes, in all his born days.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This is the strangest sort of thing I ever had anything to
do with,&rsquo; thought my uncle; &lsquo;allow me to return you your hat,
sir.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ill-looking gentleman received his three-cornered hat in
silence, looked at the hole in the middle with an inquiring air, and
finally stuck it on the top of his wig with a solemnity the effect
of which was a trifle impaired by his sneezing violently at the
moment, and jerking it off again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right!&rsquo; cried the guard with the lantern, mounting into
his little seat behind. Away they went. My uncle peeped out of
the coach-window as they emerged from the yard, and observed
that the other mails, with coachmen, guards, horses, and passengers
complete, were driving round and round in circles, at a slow trot
of about five miles an hour. My uncle burnt with indignation,
gentlemen. As a commercial man, he felt that the mail-bags were
not to be trifled with, and he resolved to memorialise the Post-office
on the subject, the very instant he reached London.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At present, however, his thoughts were occupied with the
young lady who sat in the farthest corner of the coach, with her
face muffled closely in her hood; the gentleman with the sky-blue
coat sitting opposite to her; the other man in the plum-coloured
suit, by her side; and both watching her intently. If she so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
much as rustled the folds of her hood, he could hear the ill-looking
man clap his hand upon his sword, and could tell by the other&rsquo;s
breathing (it was so dark he couldn&rsquo;t see his face) that he was
looking as big as if he were going to devour her at a mouthful.
This roused my uncle more and more, and he resolved, come what
come might, to see the end of it. He had great admiration for
bright eyes, and sweet faces, and pretty legs and feet; in short, he
was fond of the whole sex. It runs in our family, gentlemen&mdash;so
am I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many were the devices which my uncle practised, to attract
the lady&rsquo;s attention, or at all events, to engage the mysterious
gentlemen in conversation. They were all in vain; the gentlemen
wouldn&rsquo;t talk, and the lady didn&rsquo;t dare. He thrust his head
out of the coach-window at intervals, and bawled out to know why
they didn&rsquo;t go faster? But he called till he was hoarse; nobody
paid the least attention to him. He leant back in the coach, and
thought of the beautiful face, and the feet and legs. This answered
better; it wiled away the time, and kept him from wondering
where he was going, and how it was that he found himself in such
an odd situation. Not that this would have worried him much,
any way&mdash;he was a mighty free and easy, roving, devil-may-care
sort of person, was my uncle, gentlemen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All of a sudden the coach stopped. &lsquo;Hallo!&rsquo; said my uncle,
&lsquo;what&rsquo;s in the wind now?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Alight here,&rsquo; said the guard, letting down the steps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Here!&rsquo; cried my uncle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Here,&rsquo; rejoined the guard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll do nothing of the sort,&rsquo; said my uncle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Very well, then stop where you are,&rsquo; said the guard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will,&rsquo; said my uncle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do,&rsquo; said the guard.</p>

<p>The other passengers had regarded this colloquy with great
attention, and finding that my uncle was determined not to alight,
the younger man squeezed past him to hand the lady out. At this
moment the ill-looking man was inspecting the hole in the crown
of his three-cornered hat. As the young lady brushed past, she
dropped one of her gloves into my uncle&rsquo;s hand, and softly whispered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
with her lips so close to his face that he felt her warm breath
on his nose, the single word &lsquo;Help!&rsquo; Gentlemen, my uncle leaped
out of the coach at once with such violence that it rocked on the
springs again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh! You&rsquo;ve thought better of it, have you?&rsquo; said the
guard when he saw my uncle standing on the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My uncle looked at the guard for a few seconds, in some doubt
whether it wouldn&rsquo;t be better to wrench his blunderbuss from him,
fire it in the face of the man with the big sword, knock the rest of
the company over the head with the stock, snatch up the young
lady, and go off in the smoke. On second thoughts, however, he
abandoned this plan, as being a shade too melodramatic in the
execution, and followed the two mysterious men, who, keeping the
lady between them, were now entering an old house in front of
which the coach had stopped. They turned into the passage, and
my uncle followed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of all the ruinous and desolate places my uncle had ever
beheld, this was the most so. It looked as if it had once been a
large house of entertainment; but the roof had fallen in, in many
places, and the stairs were steep, rugged, and broken. There was
a huge fireplace in the room into which they walked, and the
chimney was blackened with smoke; but no warm blaze lighted it
up now. The white feathery dust of burnt wood was still strewed
over the hearth, but the stove was cold, and all was dark and
gloomy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said my uncle, as he looked about him, &lsquo;a mail travelling
at the rate of six miles and a half an hour, and stopping for an
indefinite period at such a hole as this, is rather an irregular sort of
proceeding, I fancy. This shall be made known. I&rsquo;ll write to
the papers.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My uncle said this in a pretty loud voice, and in an open,
unreserved sort of manner, with the view of engaging the two
strangers in conversation if he could. But, neither of them took
any more notice of him than whispering to each other, and
scowling at him as they did so. The lady was at the farther end
of the room, and once she ventured to wave her hand, as if
beseeching my uncle&rsquo;s assistance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;At length the two strangers advanced a little, and the conversation
began in earnest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know this is a private room, I suppose, fellow?&rdquo;
said the gentleman in sky-blue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, I do not, fellow,&rsquo; rejoined my uncle. &lsquo;Only if this is a
private room specially ordered for the occasion, I should think the
public room must be a <em>very</em> comfortable one;&rsquo; with this my uncle
sat himself down in a high-backed chair, and took such an accurate
measure of the gentleman with his eyes, that Tiggin and Welps
could have supplied him with printed calico for a suit, and not an
inch too much or too little, from that estimate alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Quit this room,&rsquo; said both the men together, grasping their
swords.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Eh?&rsquo; said my uncle, not at all appearing to comprehend
their meaning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Quit the room, or you are a dead man,&rsquo; said the ill-looking
fellow with the large sword, drawing it at the same time and
flourishing it in the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Down with him!&rsquo; cried the gentleman in sky-blue, drawing
his sword also, and falling back two or three yards. &lsquo;Down with
him!&rsquo; The lady gave a loud scream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, my uncle was always remarkable for great boldness, and
great presence of mind. All the time that he had appeared so
indifferent to what was going on, he had been looking slyly about,
for some missile or weapon of defence, and at the very instant when
the swords were drawn, he espied, standing in the chimney corner,
an old basket-hilted rapier in a rusty scabbard. At one bound,
my uncle caught it in his hand, drew it, flourished it gallantly above
his head, called aloud to the lady to keep out of the way, hurled
the chair at the man in sky-blue, and the scabbard at the man in
plum-colour, and taking advantage of the confusion, fell upon them
both, pell-mell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, there is an old story&mdash;none the worse for being
true&mdash;regarding a fine young Irish gentleman, who being asked if
he could play the fiddle, replied he had no doubt he could, but he
couldn&rsquo;t exactly say, for certain, because he had never tried. This
is not inapplicable to my uncle and his fencing. He had never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
had a sword in his hand before, except once when he played
Richard the Third at a private theatre: upon which occasion it
was arranged with Richmond that he was to be run through, from
behind, without showing fight at all. But here he was, cutting
and slashing with two experienced swordsmen: thrusting and
guarding and poking and slicing, and acquitting himself in the
most manful and dexterous manner possible, although up to that
time he had never been aware that he had the least notion of the
science. It only shows how true the old saying is, that a man
never knows what he can do, till he tries, gentlemen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The noise of the combat was terrific; each of the three combatants
swearing like troopers, and their swords clashing with as
much noise as if all the knives and steels in Newport market were
rattling together, at the same time. When it was at its very
height, the lady (to encourage my uncle most probably) withdrew
her hood entirely from her face, and disclosed a countenance of
such dazzling beauty, that he would have fought against fifty men,
to win one smile from it, and die. He had done wonders before,
but now he began to powder away like a raving mad giant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At this very moment, the gentleman in sky-blue turning
round, and seeing the young lady with her face uncovered, vented an
exclamation of rage and jealousy, and, turning his weapon against
her beautiful bosom, pointed a thrust at her heart, which caused
my uncle to utter a cry of apprehension that made the building ring.
The lady stepped lightly aside, and snatching the young man&rsquo;s
sword from his hand, before he had recovered his balance, drove
him to the wall, and running it through him, and the panelling,
up to the very hilt, pinned him there, hard and fast. It was a
splendid example. My uncle, with a loud shout of triumph, and
a strength that was irresistible, made his adversary retreat in the
same direction, and plunging the old rapier into the very centre
of a large red flower in the pattern of his waistcoat, nailed him
beside his friend; there they both stood, gentlemen, jerking their
arms and legs about, in agony, like the toy-shop figures that are
moved by a piece of packthread. My uncle always said, afterwards,
that this was one of the surest means he knew of, for disposing
of an enemy; but it was liable to one objection on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
ground of expense, inasmuch as it involved the loss of a sword
for every man disabled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The mail, the mail!&rsquo; cried the lady, running up to my
uncle and throwing her beautiful arms round his neck; &lsquo;we may
yet escape.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<em>May!</em>&rsquo; cried my uncle; &lsquo;why, my dear, there&rsquo;s nobody else
to kill, is there?&rsquo; My uncle was rather disappointed, gentlemen,
for he thought a little quiet bit of love-making would be agreeable
after the slaughtering, if it were only to change the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We have not an instant to lose here,&rsquo; said the young lady.
&lsquo;He (pointing to the young gentleman in sky-blue) is the only son
of the powerful Marquess of Filletoville.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well then, my dear, I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;ll never come to the
title,&rsquo; said my uncle, looking coolly at the young gentleman as he
stood fixed up against the wall, in the cockchafer fashion I have
described. &lsquo;You have cut off the entail, my love.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have been torn from my home and friends by these villains,&rsquo;
said the young lady, her features glowing with indignation. &lsquo;That
wretch would have married me by violence in another hour.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Confound his impudence!&rsquo; said my uncle, bestowing a very
contemptuous look on the dying heir of Filletoville.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As you may guess from what you have seen,&rsquo; said the young
lady, &lsquo;the party were prepared to murder me if I appealed to any
one for assistance. If their accomplices find us here, we are lost.
Two minutes hence may be too late. The mail!&rsquo; With these
words, overpowered by her feelings, and the exertion of sticking the
young Marquess of Filletoville, she sunk into my uncle&rsquo;s arms. My
uncle caught her up, and bore her to the house-door. There stood
the mail, with four long-tailed, flowing-maned, black horses, ready
harnessed; but no coachman, no guard, no hostler, even, at the
horses&rsquo; heads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, I hope I do no injustice to my uncle&rsquo;s memory
when I express my opinion, that although he was a bachelor, he <em>had</em>
held some ladies in his arms, before this time; I believe, indeed,
that he had rather a habit of kissing barmaids; and I know, that
in one or two instances, he had been seen, by credible witnesses,
to hug a landlady in a very perceptible manner. I mention the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
circumstance to show what a very uncommon sort of person this
beautiful young lady must have been, to have affected my uncle in
the way she did; he used to say, that as her long dark hair trailed
over his arm, and her beautiful dark eyes fixed themselves upon
his face when she recovered, he felt so strange and nervous that
his legs trembled beneath him. But, who can look in a sweet soft
pair of dark eyes, without feeling queer? <em>I</em> can&rsquo;t, gentlemen.
I am afraid to look at some eyes I know, and that&rsquo;s the truth
of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You will never leave me?&rsquo; murmured the young lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Never,&rsquo; said my uncle. And he meant it, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My dear preserver!&rsquo; exclaimed the young lady. &lsquo;My dear,
kind, brave preserver!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said my uncle, interrupting her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why?&rsquo; inquired the young lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Because your mouth looks so beautiful when you speak,&rsquo;
rejoined my uncle, &lsquo;that I&rsquo;m afraid I shall be rude enough to
kiss it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The young lady put up her hand as if to caution my uncle not
to do so, and said&mdash;no, she didn&rsquo;t say anything&mdash;she smiled. When
you are looking at a pair of the most delicious lips in the world
and see them gently break into a roguish smile&mdash;if you are very
near them, and nobody else by&mdash;you cannot better testify your
admiration of their beautiful form and colour than by kissing them
at once. My uncle did so, and I honour him for it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hark!&rsquo; cried the young lady, starting. &lsquo;The noise of wheels
and horses!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So it is,&rsquo; said my uncle, listening. He had a good ear for
wheels, and the trampling of hoofs; but there appeared to be
so many horses and carriages rattling towards them, from a distance,
that it was impossible to form a guess at their number. The sound
was like that of fifty breaks, with six blood cattle in each.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We are pursued!&rsquo; cried the young lady, clasping her hands.
&lsquo;We are pursued. I have no hope but in you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was such an expression of terror in her beautiful face
that my uncle made up his mind at once. He lifted her into the
coach, told her not to be frightened, pressed his lips to hers once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
more, and then advising her to draw up the window to keep the
cold air out, mounted the box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Stay, love,&rsquo; cried the young lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; said my uncle from the coach-box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I want to speak to you,&rsquo; said the young lady; &lsquo;only a word.
Only one word, dearest.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Must I get down?&rsquo; inquired my uncle. The lady made no
answer, but she smiled again. Such a smile, gentlemen! It beat
the other one, all to nothing. My uncle descended from his perch
in a twinkling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What is it, my dear?&rsquo; said my uncle, looking in at the
coach window. The lady happened to bend forward at the same
time, and my uncle thought she looked more beautiful than she
had done yet. He was very close to her just then, gentlemen,
so he really ought to know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What is it, my dear?&rsquo; said my uncle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Will you never love any one but me; never marry any one
beside?&rsquo; said the young lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My uncle swore a great oath that he would never marry anybody
else, and the young lady drew in her head, and pulled up the
window. He jumped upon the box, squared his elbows, adjusted
the ribbons, seized the whip which lay on the roof, gave one flick
to the off leader, and away went the four long-tailed, flowing-maned
black horses, at fifteen good English miles an hour, with the
old mail coach behind them. Whew! How they tore along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The noise behind grew louder. The faster the old mail went,
the faster came the pursuers&mdash;man, horses, dogs, were leagued in
the pursuit. The noise was frightful, but above all rose the voice
of the young lady, urging my uncle on, and shrieking, &lsquo;Faster!
Faster!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They whirled past the dark trees, as feathers would be swept
before a hurricane. Houses, gates, churches, haystacks, objects of
every kind they shot by, with a velocity and noise like roaring
waters suddenly let loose. Still the noise of pursuit grew louder,
and still my uncle could hear the young lady wildly screaming,
&lsquo;Faster! Faster!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My uncle plied whip and rein, and the horses flew onward till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
they were white with foam; and yet the noise behind increased;
and yet the young lady cried, &lsquo;Faster! Faster!&rsquo; My uncle gave a
loud stamp on the boot in the energy of the moment, and&mdash;found
that it was grey morning, and he was sitting in the wheelwright&rsquo;s
yard, on the box of an old Edinburgh mail, shivering with the
cold and wet, and stamping his feet to warm them! He got
down, and looked eagerly inside for the beautiful young lady.
Alas! There was neither door nor seat to the coach. It was a
mere shell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My uncle gave a loud stamp on the boot
in the energy of the moment&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Of course my uncle knew very well that there was some
mystery in the matter, and that everything had passed exactly as
he used to relate it. He remained staunch to the great oath he
had sworn to the beautiful young lady: refusing several eligible
landladies on her account, and dying a bachelor at last. He always
said, what a curious thing it was that he should have found out,
by such a mere accident as his clambering over the palings, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
the ghosts of mail-coaches and horses, guards, coachmen, and
passengers, were in the habit of making journeys regularly every
night. He used to add, that he believed he was the only living
person who had ever been taken as a passenger on one of these
excursions. And I think he was right, gentlemen&mdash;at least I never
heard of any other.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what these ghosts of mail-coaches carry in their
bags?&rdquo; said the landlord, who had listened to the whole story
with profound attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The dead letters, of course,&rdquo; said the bagman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, ah! To be sure,&rdquo; rejoined the landlord. &ldquo;I never
thought of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> horses were put to punctually at a quarter
before nine next morning, and Mr. Pickwick
and Sam Weller having each taken his seat,
the one inside and the other out, the postilion
was duly directed to repair in the first instance
to Mr. Bob Sawyer&rsquo;s house for the purpose of
taking up Mr. Benjamin Allen.</p>

<p>It was with feelings of no small astonishment, when the carriage
drew up before the door with the red lamp, and the very legible
inscription of &ldquo;Sawyer, late Nockemorf,&rdquo; that Mr. Pickwick saw,
on popping his head out of the coach window, the boy in the grey
livery very busily engaged in putting up the shutters: the which,
being an unusual and un-business-like proceeding at that hour
in the morning, at once suggested to his mind two inferences; the
one, that some good friend and patient of Mr. Bob Sawyer&rsquo;s was
dead; the other, that Mr. Bob Sawyer himself was bankrupt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick to the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s the matter, sir,&rdquo; replied the boy, expanding his
mouth to the whole breadth of his countenance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, all right!&rdquo; cried Bob Sawyer, suddenly appearing at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
the door with a small leathern knapsack, limp and dirty, in one
hand, and a rough coat and shawl thrown over the other arm.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going, old fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Bob Sawyer, &ldquo;and a regular expedition we&rsquo;ll
make of it. Here, Sam! Look out!&rdquo; Thus briefly bespeaking
Mr. Weller&rsquo;s attention, Mr. Bob Sawyer jerked the leathern knapsack
into the dickey, where it was immediately stowed away, under the
seat, by Sam, who regarded the proceeding with great admiration.
This done, Mr. Bob Sawyer, with the assistance of the boy, forcibly
worked himself into a rough coat, which was a few sizes too small
for him, and then advancing to the coach window thrust in his
head, and laughed boisterously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a start it is, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; cried Bob, wiping the tears out
of his eyes, with one of the cuffs of the rough coat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with some embarrassment,
&ldquo;I had no idea of your accompanying us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s just the very thing,&rdquo; replied Bob, seizing Mr. Pickwick
by the lappel of the coat. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the joke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s the joke?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Bob. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the whole point of the thing,
you know&mdash;that, and leaving the business to take care of itself, as
it seems to have made up its mind not to take care of me.&rdquo; With
this explanation of the phenomenon of the shutters, Mr. Bob
Sawyer pointed to the shop, and relapsed into an ecstasy of
mirth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless me, you are surely not mad enough to think of leaving
your patients without anybody to attend them!&rdquo; remonstrated
Mr. Pickwick in a very serious tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Bob, in reply. &ldquo;I shall save by it, you
know. None of them ever pay. Besides,&rdquo; said Bob, lowering his
voice to a confidential whisper, &ldquo;they will be all the better for it;
for, being nearly out of drugs, and not able to increase my account
just now, I should have been obliged to give them calomel all
round, and it would have been certain to have disagreed with
some of them. So it&rsquo;s all for the best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a philosophy, and a strength of reasoning, about this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
reply, which Mr. Pickwick was not prepared for. He paused a few
moments, and added, less firmly than before:</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this chaise, my young friend, will only hold two; and I
am pledged to Mr. Allen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think of me for a minute,&rdquo; replied Bob. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
arranged it all; Sam and I will share the dickey between us. Look
here. This little bill is to be wafered on the shop door: &lsquo;Sawyer,
late Nockemorf. Inquire of Mrs. Cripps, over the way.&rsquo; Mrs.
Cripps is my boy&rsquo;s mother. &lsquo;Mr. Sawyer&rsquo;s very sorry,&rsquo; says Mrs.
Cripps, &lsquo;couldn&rsquo;t help it&mdash;fetched away early this morning to a
consultation of the very first surgeons in the country&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t
do without him&mdash;would have him at any price&mdash;tremendous
operation.&rsquo; The fact is,&rdquo; said Bob in conclusion, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll do me more
good than otherwise, I expect. If it gets into one of the local
papers, it will be the making of me. Here&rsquo;s Ben; now then,
jump in!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With these hurried words Mr. Bob Sawyer pushed the postboy
on one side, jerked his friend into the vehicle, slammed the door,
put up the steps, wafered the bill on the street door, locked it, put
the key in his pocket, jumped into the dickey, gave the word
for starting, and did the whole with such extraordinary precipitation,
that before Mr. Pickwick had well begun to consider whether
Mr. Bob Sawyer ought to go or not, they were rolling away, with
Mr. Bob Sawyer thoroughly established as part and parcel of the
equipage.</p>

<p>So long as their progress was confined to the streets of Bristol,
the facetious Bob kept his professional green spectacles on, and
conducted himself with becoming steadiness and gravity of
demeanour; merely giving utterance to divers verbal witticisms
for the exclusive behoof and entertainment of Mr. Samuel Weller.
But when they emerged on the open road, he threw off his green
spectacles and his gravity together, and performed a great variety
of practical jokes, which were calculated to attract the attention of
the passers-by, and to render the carriage and those it contained
objects of more than ordinary curiosity; the least conspicuous
among these feats being, a most vociferous imitation of a key-bugle,
and the ostentatious display of a crimson silk pocket-handkerchief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
attached to a walking-stick, which was occasionally
waved in the air with various gestures indicative of supremacy and
defiance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, stopping in the midst of a most
sedate conversation with Ben Allen, bearing reference to the
numerous good qualities of Mr. Winkle and his sister: &ldquo;I wonder
what all the people we pass can see in us to make them stare so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a neat turn-out,&rdquo; replied Ben Allen, with something of
pride in his tone. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not used to see this sort of thing
every day, I daresay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;It may be so. Perhaps
it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick might very probably have reasoned himself into the
belief that it really was: had he not, just then happening to look
out of the coach window, observed that the looks of the passengers
betokened anything but respectful astonishment, and that various
telegraphic communications appeared to be passing between them
and some persons outside the vehicle: whereupon it occurred to
him that these demonstrations might be, in some remote degree,
referable to the humorous deportment of Mr. Robert Sawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;that our volatile friend is
committing no absurdities in that dickey behind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear no,&rdquo; replied Ben Allen. &ldquo;Except when he&rsquo;s elevated,
Bob&rsquo;s the quietest creature breathing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here a prolonged imitation of a key-bugle broke upon the ear,
succeeded by cheers and screams, all of which evidently proceeded
from the throat and lungs of the quietest creature breathing, or in
plainer designation, of Mr. Bob Sawyer himself.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Ben Allen looked expressively at each
other, and the former gentleman taking off his hat, and leaning
out of the coach window until nearly the whole of his waistcoat
was outside it, was at length enabled to catch a glimpse of his
facetious friend.</p>

<p>Mr. Bob Sawyer was seated: not in the dickey, but on the
roof of the chaise, with his legs as far asunder as they would conveniently
go, wearing Mr. Samuel Weller&rsquo;s hat on one side of his
head, and bearing, in one hand, a most enormous sandwich, while,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
in the other, he supported a goodly-sized case-bottle, to both of
which he applied himself with intense relish: varying the monotony
of the occupation by an occasional howl, or the interchange
of some lively badinage with any passing stranger. The crimson
flag was carefully tied in an erect position to the rail of the dickey;
and Mr. Samuel Weller, decorated with Bob Sawyer&rsquo;s hat, was
seated in the centre thereof, discussing a twin sandwich, with an
animated countenance, the expression of which betokened his
entire and perfect approval of the whole arrangement.</p>

<p>This was enough to irritate a gentleman of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s sense
of propriety, but it was not the whole extent of the aggravation, for
a stage-coach, full inside and out, was meeting them at the moment,
and the astonishment of the passengers was very palpably evinced.
The congratulations of an Irish family, too, who were keeping up
with the chaise, and begging all the time, were of a rather boisterous
description; especially those of its male head, who appeared to
consider the display as part and parcel of some political or other
procession of triumph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Sawyer!&rdquo; cried Mr. Pickwick, in a state of great excitement.
&ldquo;Mr. Sawyer, sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; responded that gentleman, looking over the side of
the chaise with all the coolness in life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you mad, sir?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; replied Bob; &ldquo;only cheerful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cheerful, sir!&rdquo; ejaculated Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;Take down that
scandalous red handkerchief, I beg. I insist, sir. Sam, take it
down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before Sam could interpose, Mr. Bob Sawyer gracefully struck
his colours, and having put them in his pocket, nodded in a
courteous manner to Mr. Pickwick, wiped the mouth of the case-bottle,
and applied it to his own; thereby informing him, without
any unnecessary waste of words, that he devoted that draught to
wishing him all manner of happiness and prosperity. Having done
this, Bob replaced the cork with great care, and looking benignantly
down on Mr. Pickwick, took a large bite out of the sandwich, and
smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, whose momentary anger was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
quite proof against Bob&rsquo;s immovable self-possession, &ldquo;pray let us
have no more of this absurdity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied Bob, once more exchanging hats with Mr.
Weller; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to do it, only I got so enlivened with the
ride that I couldn&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think of the look of the thing,&rdquo; expostulated Mr. Pickwick;
&ldquo;have some regard to appearances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, certainly,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not the sort of thing at all.
All over, governor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Satisfied with this assurance, Mr. Pickwick once more drew his
head into the chaise and pulled up the glass; but he had scarcely
resumed the conversation which Mr. Bob Sawyer had interrupted,
when he was somewhat startled by the apparition of a small dark
body, of an oblong form, on the outside of the window, which
gave sundry taps against it, as if impatient of admission.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks like a case-bottle;&rdquo; remarked Ben Allen, eyeing the
object in question through his spectacles with some interest; &ldquo;I
rather think it belongs to Bob.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The impression was perfectly accurate; for Mr. Bob Sawyer,
having attached the case-bottle to the end of the walking-stick,
was battering the window with it in token of his wish that his
friends inside would partake of its contents, in all good fellowship
and harmony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, looking at the bottle.
&ldquo;This proceeding is more absurd than the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it would be best to take it in,&rdquo; replied Mr. Ben Allen;
&ldquo;it would serve him right to take it and keep it, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick: &ldquo;shall I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it the most proper course we could possibly adopt,&rdquo;
replied Ben.</p>

<p>This advice quite coinciding with his own opinion, Mr. Pickwick
gently let down the window and disengaged the bottle from the
stick: upon which the latter was drawn up, and Mr. Bob Sawyer
was heard to laugh heartily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a merry dog it is!&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, looking round at
his companion with the bottle in his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He is,&rdquo; said Mr. Allen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot possibly be angry with him,&rdquo; remarked Mr.
Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite out of the question,&rdquo; observed Benjamin Allen.</p>

<p>During this short interchange of sentiments, Mr. Pickwick had,
in an abstracted mood, uncorked the bottle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; inquired Ben Allen, carelessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, with equal carelessness.
&ldquo;It smells, I think, like milk-punch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed?&rdquo; said Ben.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>think</em> so,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Pickwick, very properly guarding
himself against the possibility of stating an untruth: &ldquo;mind, I
could not undertake to say certainly, without tasting it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better do so,&rdquo; said Ben, &ldquo;we may as well know what
it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;Well; if you
are curious to know, of course I have no objection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ever willing to sacrifice his own feelings to the wishes of his
friend, Mr. Pickwick at once took a pretty long taste.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; inquired Ben Allen, interrupting him with some
impatience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Curious,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, smacking his lips, &ldquo;I hardly
know now. Oh yes!&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, after a second taste.
&ldquo;It <em>is</em> punch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Ben Allen looked at Mr. Pickwick; Mr. Pickwick looked
at Mr. Ben Allen; Mr. Ben Allen smiled; Mr. Pickwick did
not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would serve him right,&rdquo; said the last-named gentleman,
with some severity, &ldquo;it would serve him right to drink it every
drop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The very thing that occurred to me,&rdquo; said Ben Allen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it indeed?&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;Then here&rsquo;s his
health!&rdquo; With these words, that excellent person took a most
energetic pull at the bottle, and handed it to Ben Allen, who
was not slow to imitate his example. The smiles became
mutual, and the milk-punch was gradually and cheerfully disposed
of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, as he drained the last drop, &ldquo;his
pranks are really very amusing: very entertaining indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may say that,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Ben Allen. In proof of Bob
Sawyer&rsquo;s being one of the funniest fellows alive, he proceeded to
entertain Mr. Pickwick with a long and circumstantial account
how that gentleman once drank himself into a fever and got his
head shaved; the relation of which pleasant and agreeable history
was only stopped by the stoppage of the chaise at the Bell at
Berkeley Heath, to change horses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say! We&rsquo;re going to dine here, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; said Bob, looking
in at the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dine!&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;Why, we have only come
nineteen miles, and have eighty-seven and a half to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just the reason why we should take something to enable
us to bear up against the fatigue,&rdquo; remonstrated Mr. Bob Sawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s quite impossible to dine at half-past eleven o&rsquo;clock in
the day,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, looking at his watch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; rejoined Bob, &ldquo;lunch is the very thing. Hallo, you
sir! Lunch for three, directly, and keep the horses back for a
quarter of an hour. Tell them to put everything they have cold
on the table and some bottled ale, and let us taste your very best
Madeira.&rdquo; Issuing these orders with monstrous importance and
bustle, Mr. Bob Sawyer at once hurried into the house to superintend
the arrangements; in less than five minutes he returned and
declared them to be excellent.</p>

<p>The quality of the lunch fully justified the eulogium which Bob
had pronounced, and very great justice was done to it, not only by
that gentleman, but Mr. Ben Allen and Mr. Pickwick also. Under
the auspices of the three, the bottled ale and the Madeira were
promptly disposed of; and when (the horses being once more put
to) they resumed their seats, with the case-bottle full of the best
substitute for milk-punch that could be procured on so short a
notice, the key-bugle sounded, and the red flag waved, without the
slightest opposition on Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s part.</p>

<p>At the Hop Pole at Tewkesbury, they stopped to dine; upon
which occasion there was more bottled ale, with some more Madeira,
and some port besides; and here the case-bottle was replenished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
for the third time. Under the influence of these combined stimulants,
Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Ben Allen fell fast asleep for thirty
miles, while Bob and Mr. Weller sang duets in the dickey.</p>

<p>It was quite dark when Mr. Pickwick roused himself sufficiently
to look out of the window. The straggling cottages by the roadside,
the dingy hue of every object visible, the murky atmosphere,
the paths of cinders and brick-dust, the deep-red glow of furnace
fires in the distance, the volumes of dense smoke issuing heavily
forth from the high toppling chimneys, blackening and obscuring
everything around; the glare of distant lights, the ponderous
waggons which toiled along the road, laden with clashing rods of
iron, or piled with heavy goods&mdash;all betokened their rapid approach
to the great working town of Birmingham.</p>

<p>As they rattled through the narrow thoroughfares leading to the
heart of the turmoil, the sights and sounds of earnest occupation
struck more forcibly on the senses. The streets were thronged with
working-people. The hum of labour resounded from every house,
lights gleamed from the long casement windows in the attic stories,
and the whirl of wheels and noise of machinery shook the trembling
walls. The fires, whose lurid, sullen light had been visible for miles,
blazed fiercely up, in the great works and factories of the town.
The din of hammers, the rushing of steam, and the dead heavy
clanking of engines, was the harsh music which arose from every
quarter.</p>

<p>The postboy was driving briskly through the open streets, and
past the handsome and well-lighted shops which intervene between
the outskirts of the town and the Old Royal Hotel, before Mr.
Pickwick had begun to consider the very difficult and delicate
nature of the commission which had carried him thither.</p>

<p>The delicate nature of this commission, and the difficulty of
executing it in a satisfactory manner, were by no means lessened by
the voluntary companionship of Mr. Bob Sawyer. Truth to tell,
Mr. Pickwick felt that his presence on the occasion, however
considerate and gratifying, was by no means an honour he would
willingly have sought; in fact, he would cheerfully have given a
reasonable sum of money to have had Mr. Bob Sawyer removed to
any place at not less than fifty miles distance, without delay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick had never held any personal communication with
Mr. Winkle senior, although he had once or twice corresponded
with him by letter, and returned satisfactory answers to his inquiries
concerning the moral character and behaviour of his son; he felt
nervously sensible that to wait upon him, for the first time, attended
by Bob Sawyer and Ben Allen, both slightly fuddled, was not the
most ingenious and likely means that could have been hit upon to
prepossess him in his favour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;However,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, endeavouring to reassure himself,
&ldquo;I must do the best I can. I must see him to-night, for
I faithfully promised to do so. If they persist in accompanying
me, I must make the interview as brief as possible, and be content
to hope that, for their own sakes, they will not expose
themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he comforted himself with these reflections, the chaise
stopped at the door of the Old Royal. Ben Allen having been
partially awakened from a stupendous sleep, and dragged out by
the collar by Mr. Samuel Weller, Mr. Pickwick was enabled to
alight. They were shown to a comfortable apartment, and Mr.
Pickwick at once propounded a question to the waiter concerning
the whereabout of Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s residence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Close by, sir,&rdquo; said the waiter, &ldquo;not above five hundred yards,
sir. Mr. Winkle is a wharfinger, sir, at the canal, sir. Private
residence is not&mdash;oh dear no, sir, <em>not</em> five hundred yards, sir.&rdquo;
Here the waiter blew a candle out, and made a feint of lighting
it again, in order to afford Mr. Pickwick an opportunity of asking
any further questions, if he felt so disposed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take anything now, sir?&rdquo; said the waiter, lighting the candle
in desperation at Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s silence. &ldquo;Tea or coffee, sir?
Dinner, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good, sir. Like to order supper, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not just now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Very</em> good, sir.&rdquo; Here, he walked softly to the door, and then
stopping short, turned round and said, with great suavity:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I send the chambermaid, gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may, if you please,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If <em>you</em> please, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And bring some soda water,&rdquo; said Bob Sawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soda water, sir? Yes, sir.&rdquo; With his mind apparently
relieved from an overwhelming weight, by having at last got an
order for something, the waiter imperceptibly melted away.
Waiters never walk or run. They have a peculiar and mysterious
power of skimming out of rooms, which other mortals possess not.</p>

<p>Some slight symptoms of vitality having been awakened in Mr.
Ben Allen by the soda water, he suffered himself to be prevailed
upon to wash his face and hands, and to submit to be brushed by
Sam. Mr. Pickwick and Bob Sawyer having also repaired the
disorder which the journey had made in their apparel, the three
started forth, arm in arm, to Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s; Bob Sawyer impregnating
the atmosphere with tobacco smoke as he walked along.</p>

<p>About a quarter of a mile off, in a quiet, substantial-looking
street, stood an old red-brick house with three steps before the
door, and a brass plate upon it, bearing, in fat Roman capitals, the
words, &ldquo;Mr. Winkle.&rdquo; The steps were very white, and the bricks
were very red, and the house was very clean; and here stood Mr.
Pickwick, Mr. Benjamin Allen, and Mr. Bob Sawyer, as the clock
struck ten.</p>

<p>A smart servant girl answered the door, and started on beholding
the three strangers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Mr. Winkle at home, my dear?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is just going to supper, sir,&rdquo; replied the girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give him that card, if you please,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Pickwick.
&ldquo;Say I am sorry to trouble him at so late an hour; but I am
anxious to see him to-night, and have only just arrived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl looked timidly at Mr. Bob Sawyer, who was expressing
his admiration of her personal charms by a variety of wonderful
grimaces; and casting an eye at the hats and great-coats which
hung in the passage, called another girl to mind the door while she
went upstairs. The sentinel was speedily relieved; for the girl
returned immediately, and begging pardon of the gentlemen for
leaving them in the street, ushered them into a floor-clothed back
parlour, half office and half dressing-room, in which the principal
useful and ornamental articles of furniture were a desk, a wash-hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
stand and shaving glass, a boot-rack and boot-jack, a high
stool, four chairs, a table, and an old eight-day clock. Over the
mantelpiece were the sunken doors of an iron safe, while a couple
of hanging shelves for books, an almanack, and several files of dusty
papers, decorated the walls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very sorry to leave you standing at the door, sir,&rdquo; said the
girl, lighting a lamp, and addressing Mr. Pickwick with a winning
smile, &ldquo;but you was quite strangers to me; and we have such
a many trampers that only come to see what they can lay their
hands on, that <span class="nobreak">really&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There is not the least occasion for any apology, my dear,&rdquo; said
Mr. Pickwick, good-humouredly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not the slightest, my love,&rdquo; said Bob Sawyer, playfully
stretching forth his arms, and skipping from side to side, as if to
prevent the young lady&rsquo;s leaving the room.</p>

<p>The young lady was not at all softened by these allurements, for
she at once expressed her opinion that Mr. Bob Sawyer was an
&ldquo;odous creetur;&rdquo; and, on his becoming rather more pressing in
his attentions, imprinted her fair fingers upon his face, and bounced
out of the room with many expressions of aversion and contempt.</p>

<p>Deprived of the young lady&rsquo;s society, Mr. Bob Sawyer proceeded
to divert himself by peeping into the desk, looking into all the
table-drawers, feigning to pick the lock of the iron safe, turning the
almanack with its face to the wall, trying on the boots of Mr.
Winkle senior over his own, and making several other humorous
experiments upon the furniture, all of which afforded Mr. Pickwick
unspeakable horror and agony, and yielded Mr. Bob Sawyer proportionate
delight.</p>

<p>At length the door opened, and a little old gentleman in a snuff-coloured
suit, with a head and face the precise counterpart of those
belonging to Mr. Winkle junior, excepting that he was rather bald,
trotted into the room with Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s card in one hand, and a
silver candlestick in the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pickwick, sir, how do you do?&rdquo; said Winkle the elder,
putting down the candlestick and proffering his hand. &ldquo;Hope I
see you well, sir? Glad to see you. Be seated, Mr. Pickwick, I
beg, sir. This gentleman <span class="nobreak">is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My friend, Mr. Sawyer,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;your
son&rsquo;s friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Mr. Winkle the elder, looking rather grimly at Bob.
&ldquo;I hope <em>you</em> are well, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right as a trivet, sir,&rdquo; replied Bob Sawyer.</p>

<div class="figleft"><a id="ill12"></a>
<img src="images/ill12.png" width="237" height="380" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>Mr. Winkle senior</p>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;This other gentleman,&rdquo; cried
Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;is, as you will see,
when you have read the letter with
which I am entrusted, a very near
relative or, I should rather say, a very
particular friend of your son&rsquo;s. His
name is Allen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>That</em> gentleman?&rdquo; inquired Mr.
Winkle, pointing with the card towards
Ben Allen, who had fallen asleep in
an attitude which left nothing of him
visible but his spine and his coat
collar.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick was on the point of
replying to the question, and reciting
Mr. Benjamin Allen&rsquo;s name and
honourable distinctions at full length,
when the sprightly Mr. Bob Sawyer,
with a view of rousing his friend to
a sense of his situation, inflicted a
startling pinch upon the fleshy part of
his arm, which caused him to jump
up with a shriek. Suddenly aware that
he was in the presence of a stranger,
Mr. Ben Allen advanced and, shaking Mr. Winkle most affectionately
by both hands for about five minutes, murmured, in
some half-intelligible fragments of sentences, the great delight he
felt in seeing him, and a hospitable inquiry whether he felt disposed
to take anything after his walk, or would prefer waiting &ldquo;till
dinner time;&rdquo; which done, he sat down and gazed about him with
a petrified stare, as if he had not the remotest idea where he was,
which indeed he had not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>All this was most embarrassing to Mr. Pickwick, the more
especially as Mr. Winkle senior evinced palpable astonishment
at the eccentric&mdash;not to say extraordinary&mdash;behaviour of his
two companions. To bring the matter to an issue at once, he
drew a letter from his pocket, and presenting it to Mr. Winkle
senior, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This letter, sir, is from your son. You will see, by its contents,
that on your favourable and fatherly consideration of it, depend his
future happiness and welfare. Will you oblige me by giving it the
calmest and coolest perusal, and by discussing the subject afterwards
with me, in the tone and spirit in which alone it ought to be
discussed? You may judge of the importance of your decision to
your son, and his intense anxiety upon the subject, by my waiting
upon you without any previous warning, at so late an hour; and,&rdquo;
added Mr. Pickwick, glancing slightly at his two companions, &ldquo;and
under such unfavourable circumstances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this prelude, Mr. Pickwick placed four closely written sides
of extra superfine wire-woven penitence in the hands of the astounded
Mr. Winkle senior. Then reseating himself in his chair,
he watched his looks and manner: anxiously, it is true, but with
the open front of a gentleman who feels he has taken no part which
he need excuse or palliate.</p>

<p>The old wharfinger turned the letter over; looked at the front,
back, and sides; made a microscopic examination of the fat little
boy on the seal; raised his eyes to Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s face; and then,
seating himself on the high stool, and drawing the lamp closer to
him, broke the wax, unfolded the epistle, and lifting it to the light,
he prepared to read.</p>

<p>Just at this moment, Mr. Bob Sawyer, whose wit had lain dormant
for some minutes, placed his hands upon his knees, and made
a face after the portrait of the late Mr. Grimaldi, as clown. It so
happened that Mr. Winkle senior, instead of being deeply engaged
in reading the letter, as Mr. Bob Sawyer thought, chanced to be
looking over the top of it at no less a person than Mr. Bob Sawyer
himself; rightly conjecturing that the face aforesaid was made in
ridicule and derision of his own person, he fixed his eyes on Bob with
such expressive sternness, that the late Mr. Grimaldi&rsquo;s lineaments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
gradually resolved themselves into a very fine expression of humility
and confusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you speak, sir?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Winkle senior, after an
awful silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied Bob, with no remains of the clown about
him, save and except the extreme redness of his cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are sure you did not, sir?&rdquo; said Mr. Winkle senior.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear yes, sir, quite,&rdquo; replied Bob.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you did, sir,&rdquo; rejoined the old gentleman, with
indignant emphasis. &ldquo;Perhaps you <em>looked</em> at me, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, sir! not at all,&rdquo; replied Bob, with extreme civility.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very glad to hear it, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Winkle senior.
Having frowned upon the abashed Bob with great magnificence,
the old gentleman again brought the letter to the light, and began
to read it seriously.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick eyed him intently as he turned from the bottom
line of the first page to the top line of the second, and from the
bottom of the second to the top of the third, and from the bottom
of the third to the top of the fourth; but not the slightest alteration
of countenance afforded a clue to the feelings with which
he received the announcement of his son&rsquo;s marriage, which Mr.
Pickwick knew was in the very first half-dozen lines.</p>

<p>He read the letter to the last word; folded it again with all the
carefulness and precision of a man of business; and, just when
Mr. Pickwick expected some great outbreak of feeling, dipped a pen
in the inkstand, and said as quietly as if he were speaking on the
most ordinary counting-house topic:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is Nathaniel&rsquo;s address, Mr. Pickwick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The George and Vulture, at present,&rdquo; replied that gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;George and Vulture. Where is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;George Yard, Lombard Street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the City?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old gentleman methodically indorsed the address on the
back of the letter; and then, placing it in the desk, which he
locked, said as he got off the stool and placed the bunch of keys in
his pocket:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose there is nothing else which need detain us, Mr.
Pickwick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing else, my dear sir!&rdquo; observed that warm-hearted
person in indignant amazement. &ldquo;Nothing else! Have you no
opinion to express on this momentous event in our young friend&rsquo;s
life? No assurance to convey to him, through me, of the continuance
of your affection and protection? Nothing to say which
will cheer and sustain him, and the anxious girl who looks to him
for comfort and support? My dear sir, consider.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will consider,&rdquo; replied the old gentleman. &ldquo;I have nothing
to say just now. I am a man of business, Mr. Pickwick. I never
commit myself hastily in any affair, and from what I see of this, I
by no means like the appearance of it. A thousand pounds is not
much, Mr. Pickwick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very right, sir,&rdquo; interposed Ben Allen, just awake
enough to know that he had spent <em>his</em> thousand pounds without
the smallest difficulty. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an intelligent man. Bob, he&rsquo;s a
very knowing fellow this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very happy to find that <em>you</em> do me the justice to make
the admission, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Winkle senior, looking contemptuously
at Ben Allen, who was shaking his head profoundly. &ldquo;The fact is,
Mr. Pickwick, that when I gave my son a roving license for a year
or so, to see something of men and manners (which he has done
under your auspices), so that he might not enter into life a mere
boarding-school milk-sop to be gulled by everybody, I never
bargained for this. He knows that, very well, so if I withdraw my
countenance from him on this account, he has no call to be surprised.
He shall hear from me, Mr. Pickwick. Good night, sir.
Margaret, open the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this time, Bob Sawyer had been nudging Mr. Ben Allen to
say something on the right side; Ben accordingly now burst, without
the slightest preliminary notice, into a brief but impassioned
piece of eloquence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Ben Allen, staring at the old gentleman, out
of a pair of very dim and languid eyes, and working his right
arm vehemently up and down, &ldquo;you&mdash;you ought to be ashamed of
yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;As the lady&rsquo;s brother, of course you are an excellent judge
of the question,&rdquo; retorted Mr. Winkle senior. &ldquo;There; that&rsquo;s
enough. Pray say no more, Mr. Pickwick. Good night, gentlemen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With these words the old gentleman took up the candlestick,
and opening the room door, politely motioned towards the
passage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will regret this, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, setting his teeth
close together to keep down his choler; for he felt how important
the effect might prove to his young friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am at present of a different opinion,&rdquo; calmly replied Mr.
Winkle senior. &ldquo;Once again, gentlemen, I wish you a good
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick walked, with angry strides, into the street. Mr.
Bob Sawyer, completely quelled by the decision of the old gentleman&rsquo;s
manner, took the same course. Mr. Ben Allen&rsquo;s hat rolled
down the steps immediately afterwards, and Mr. Ben Allen&rsquo;s body
followed it directly. The whole party went silent and supperless
to bed; and Mr. Pickwick thought, just before he fell asleep, that
if he had known Mr. Winkle senior had been quite so much of a
man of business, it was extremely probable he might never have
waited upon him, on such an errand.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> morning which broke upon Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
sight, at eight o&rsquo;clock, was not at all calculated
to elevate his spirits, or to lessen the depression
which the unlooked-for result of his embassy
inspired. The sky was dark and gloomy, the
air was damp and raw, the streets were wet and
sloppy. The smoke hung sluggishly above the
chimney-tops as if it lacked the courage to rise, and the rain
came slowly and doggedly down, as if it had not even the spirit
to pour. A game-cock in the stable-yard, deprived of every spark
of his accustomed animation, balanced himself dismally on one leg
in a corner; a donkey, moping with drooping head under the
narrow roof of an outhouse, appeared from his meditative and
miserable countenance to be contemplating suicide. In the street,
umbrellas were the only things to be seen, and the clicking of
pattens and splashing of rain-drops, were the only sounds to be
heard.</p>

<p>The breakfast was interrupted by very little conversation; even
Mr. Bob Sawyer felt the influence of the weather, and the previous
day&rsquo;s excitement. In his own expressive language he was &ldquo;floored.&rdquo;
So was Mr. Ben Allen. So was Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>In protracted expectation of the weather clearing up, the last
evening paper from London was read and re-read with an intensity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
of interest only known in cases of extreme destitution; every inch
of the carpet was walked over, with similar perseverance; the
windows were looked out of, often enough to justify the imposition
of an additional duty upon them; all kinds of topics of conversation
were started and failed; and at length Mr. Pickwick, when noon
had arrived, without a change for the better, rang the bell resolutely
and ordered out the chaise.</p>

<p>Although the roads were miry, and the drizzling rain came
down harder than it had done yet, and although the mud and wet
splashed in at the open windows of the carriage to such an extent
that the discomfort was almost as great to the pair of insides as to
the pair of outsides, still there was something in the motion, and
the sense of being up and doing, which was so infinitely superior
to being pent in a dull room, looking at the dull rain dripping into
a dull street, that they all agreed, on starting, that the change was
a great improvement, and wondered how they could possibly have
delayed making it, as long as they had done.</p>

<p>When they stopped to change at Coventry, the steam ascended
from the horses in such clouds as wholly to obscure the hostler,
whose voice was however heard to declare from the mist, that he
expected the first Gold Medal from the Humane Society on their
next distribution of rewards, for taking the postboy&rsquo;s hat off; the
water descending from the brim of which the invisible gentleman
declared must inevitably have drowned him (the postboy), but for
his great presence of mind in tearing it promptly from his
head, and drying the gasping man&rsquo;s countenance with a wisp
of straw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is pleasant,&rdquo; said Bob Sawyer, turning up his coat collar,
and pulling the shawl over his mouth to concentrate the fumes of
a glass of brandy just swallowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wery,&rdquo; replied Sam, composedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to mind it?&rdquo; observed Bob.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vy, I don&rsquo;t exactly see no good my mindin&rsquo; on it &rsquo;ud do,
sir,&rdquo; replied Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an unanswerable reason, anyhow,&rdquo; said Bob.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Weller. &ldquo;Wotever is, is right, as the
young nobleman sveetly remarked ven they put him down in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
pension list &rsquo;cos his mother&rsquo;s uncle&rsquo;s vife&rsquo;s grandfather vunce lit the
king&rsquo;s pipe vith a portable tinder-box.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bad notion that, Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Bob Sawyer, approvingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just wot the young nobleman said ev&rsquo;ry quarter-day arterward
for the rest of his life,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wos you ever called in,&rdquo; inquired Sam, glancing at the driver,
after a short silence, and lowering his voice to a mysterious whisper,
&ldquo;wos you ever called in, ven you wos &rsquo;prentice to a sawbones, to
wisit a postboy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember that I ever was,&rdquo; replied Bob Sawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never see a postboy in that &rsquo;ere hospital as you <em>walked</em>
(as they says o&rsquo; the ghosts), did you?&rdquo; demanded Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Bob Sawyer. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I ever did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never know&rsquo;d a churchyard vere there wos a postboy&rsquo;s tombstone,
or see a dead postboy, did you?&rdquo; inquired Sam, pursuing
his catechism.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; rejoined Bob, &ldquo;I never did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; rejoined Sam, triumphantly. &ldquo;Nor never vill; and
there&rsquo;s another thing that no man never see, and that&rsquo;s a dead
donkey. No man never see a dead donkey, &rsquo;cept the gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n in
the black silk smalls as know&rsquo;d a young &rsquo;ooman as kep&rsquo; a goat;
and that wos a French donkey, so wery likely he warn&rsquo;t vun o&rsquo; the
reg&rsquo;lar breed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what has that got to do with the postboys?&rdquo; asked
Bob Sawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This here,&rdquo; replied Sam. &ldquo;Without goin&rsquo; so far as to as-sert,
as some wery sensible people do, that postboys and donkeys is
both immortal, wot I say is this; that venever they feels theirselves
gettin&rsquo; stiff and past their work, they just rides off together, vun
postboy to a pair in the usual way; wot becomes on &rsquo;em nobody
knows, but it&rsquo;s wery probable as they starts avay to take their
pleasure in some other world, for there ain&rsquo;t a man alive as ever
see, either a donkey or a postboy, a takin&rsquo; his pleasure in this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Expatiating upon this learned and remarkable theory, and citing
many curious statistical and other facts in its support, Sam Weller
beguiled the time until they reached Dunchurch, where a dry postboy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
and fresh horses were procured; the next stage was Daventry,
and the next Towcester; and at the end of each stage it rained
harder than it had done at the beginning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; remonstrated Bob Sawyer, looking in at the coach
window, as they rolled up before the door of the Saracen&rsquo;s Head,
Towcester, &ldquo;this won&rsquo;t do, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless me!&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, just awakening from a nap,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re wet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh you are, are you?&rdquo; returned Bob. &ldquo;Yes, I am, a little
that way. Uncomfortably damp, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bob did look dampish, inasmuch as the rain was streaming from
his neck, elbows, cuffs, skirts, and knees; and his whole apparel
shone so with the wet, that it might have been mistaken for a full
suit of prepared oilskin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>am</em> rather wet,&rdquo; said Bob, giving himself a shake, and casting
a little hydraulic shower around, like a Newfoundland dog just
emerged from the water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s quite impossible to go on to-night,&rdquo; interposed
Ben.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out of the question, sir,&rdquo; remarked Sam Weller, coming to
assist in the conference; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s cruelty to animals, sir, to ask &rsquo;em
to do it. There&rsquo;s beds here, sir,&rdquo; said Sam, addressing his master,
&ldquo;everything clean and comfortable. Wery good little dinner, sir,
they can get ready in half-an-hour&mdash;pair of fowls, sir, and a weal
cutlet; French beans, &rsquo;taturs, tart, and tidiness. You&rsquo;d better stop
vere you are sir, if I might recommend. Take advice, sir, as the
doctor said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The host of the Saracen&rsquo;s Head opportunely appeared at this
moment, to confirm Mr. Weller&rsquo;s statement relative to the accommodations
of the establishment, and to back his entreaties with a
variety of dismal conjectures regarding the state of the roads, the
doubt of fresh horses being to be had at the next stage, the dead
certainty of its raining all night, the equally mortal certainty of its
clearing up in the morning, and other topics of inducement familiar
to innkeepers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &ldquo;but I must send a letter to
London by some conveyance, so that it may be delivered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
very first thing in the morning, or I must go forward at all
hazards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The landlord smiled his delight. Nothing could be easier than
for the gentleman to inclose a letter in a sheet of brown paper, and
send it on, either by the mail or the night coach from Birmingham.
If the gentleman were particularly anxious to have it left as soon
as possible, he might write outside, &ldquo;To be delivered immediately,&rdquo;
which was sure to be attended to; or &ldquo;Pay the bearer half-a-crown
extra for instant delivery,&rdquo; which was surer still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;then we will stop here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lights in the Sun, John; make up the fire; the gentlemen
are wet!&rdquo; cried the landlord. &ldquo;This way, gentlemen; don&rsquo;t
trouble yourselves about the postboy now, sir. I&rsquo;ll send him to
you when you ring for him, sir. Now, John, the candles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The candles were brought, the fire was stirred up, and a fresh
log of wood thrown on. In ten minutes&rsquo; time, a waiter was laying
the cloth for dinner, the curtains were drawn, the fire was blazing
brightly, and everything looked (as everything always does, in all
decent English inns) as if the travellers had been expected, and
their comforts prepared, for days beforehand.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick sat down at a side table, and hastily indited a note
to Mr. Winkle, merely informing him that he was detained by stress
of weather, but would certainly be in London next day; until
when he deferred any account of his proceedings. This note was
hastily made into a parcel, and dispatched to the bar per Mr.
Samuel Weller.</p>

<p>Sam left it with the landlady, and was returning to pull his
master&rsquo;s boots off, after drying himself by the kitchen fire, when,
glancing casually through a half-opened door, he was arrested by
the sight of a gentleman with a sandy head who had a large
bundle of newspapers lying on the table before him, and was
perusing the leading article of one with a settled sneer which
curled up his nose and all his other features into a majestic expression
of haughty contempt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;I ought to know that &rsquo;ere head and
them features; the eye-glass, too, and the broad-brimmed tile!
Eatansvill to vit, or I&rsquo;m a Roman.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>Sam was taken with a troublesome cough, at once, for the
purpose of attracting the gentleman&rsquo;s attention; the gentleman
starting at the sound, raised his head and his eye-glass, and disclosed
to view the profound and thoughtful features of Mr. Pott,
of the <cite>Eatanswill Gazette</cite>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beggin&rsquo; your pardon, sir,&rdquo; said Sam, advancing with a bow,
&ldquo;my master&rsquo;s here, Mr. Pott.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, hush!&rdquo; cried Pott, drawing Sam into the room, and
closing the door, with a countenance of mysterious dread and
apprehension.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s the matter, sir?&rdquo; inquired Sam, looking vacantly about
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a whisper of my name,&rdquo; replied Pott; &ldquo;this is a buff
neighbourhood. If the excited and irritable populace knew I was
here, I should be torn to pieces.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! Vould you, sir?&rdquo; inquired Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should be the victim of their fury,&rdquo; replied Pott. &ldquo;Now,
young man, what of your master?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a stopping here to-night on his vay to town, vith a
couple of friends,&rdquo; replied Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Mr. Winkle one of them?&rdquo; inquired Pott, with a slight
frown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir. Mr. Vinkle stops at home now,&rdquo; rejoined Sam.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Married!&rdquo; exclaimed Pott, with frightful vehemence. He
stopped, smiled darkly, and added, in a low, vindictive tone: &ldquo;It
serves him right!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having given vent to this cruel ebullition of deadly malice and
cold-blooded triumph over a fallen enemy, Mr. Pott inquired
whether Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s friends were &ldquo;blue&rdquo;? Receiving a most
satisfactory answer in the affirmative from Sam, who knew as much
about the matter as Pott himself, he consented to accompany him
to Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s room, where a hearty welcome awaited him.
An agreement to club dinners together was at once made and
ratified.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how are matters going on in Eatanswill?&rdquo; inquired Mr.
Pickwick, when Pott had taken a seat near the fire, and the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
party had got their wet boots off, and dry slippers on. &ldquo;Is the
<cite>Independent</cite> still in being?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <cite>Independent</cite>, sir,&rdquo; replied Pott, &ldquo;is still dragging on a
wretched and lingering career. Abhorred and despised by even the
few who are cognizant of its miserable and disgraceful existence;
stifled by the very filth it so profusely scatters; rendered deaf and
blind by the exhalations of its own slime; the obscene journal,
happily unconscious of its degraded state, is rapidly sinking beneath
that treacherous mud which, while it seems to give it a firm standing
with the low and debased classes of society, is, nevertheless, rising
above its detested head, and will speedily engulf it for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having delivered this manifesto (which formed portion of his
last week&rsquo;s leader) with a vehement articulation, the editor paused
to take breath and looked majestically at Bob Sawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a young man, sir,&rdquo; said Pott.</p>

<p>Mr. Bob Sawyer nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So are you, sir,&rdquo; said Pott, addressing Mr. Ben Allen.</p>

<p>Ben admitted the soft impeachment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And are both deeply imbued with those blue principles, which,
as long as I live, I have pledged myself to the people of these
kingdoms to support and to maintain?&rdquo; suggested Pott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t exactly know about that,&rdquo; replied Bob Sawyer.
&ldquo;I <span class="nobreak">am&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not buff, Mr. Pickwick,&rdquo; interrupted Pott, drawing back his
chair, &ldquo;your friend is not buff, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; rejoined Bob, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a kind of plaid at present; a
compound of all sorts of colours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A waverer,&rdquo; said Pott, solemnly, &ldquo;a waverer. I should like to
show you a series of eight articles, sir, that have appeared in the
<cite>Eatanswill Gazette</cite>. I think I may venture to say that you would
not be long in establishing your opinions on a firm and solid blue
basis, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say I should turn very blue, long before I got to the
end of them,&rdquo; responded Bob.</p>

<p>Mr. Pott looked dubiously at Bob Sawyer for some seconds, and,
turning to Mr. Pickwick, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have seen the literary articles which have appeared at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
intervals in the <cite>Eatanswill Gazette</cite> in the course of the last three
months, and which have excited such general&mdash;I may say such
universal&mdash;attention and admiration?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, slightly embarrassed by the
question, &ldquo;the fact is, I have been so much engaged in other ways,
that I really have not had an opportunity of perusing them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should do so, sir,&rdquo; said Pott, with a severe countenance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They appeared in the form of a copious review of a work on
Chinese metaphysics, sir,&rdquo; said Pott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; observed Mr. Pickwick; &ldquo;from your pen, I hope?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From the pen of my critic, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Pott, with dignity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An abstruse subject, I should conceive,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very, sir,&rdquo; responded Pott, looking intensely sage. &ldquo;He
<em>crammed</em> for it, to use a technical but expressive term; he read up
for the subject, at my desire, in the <cite>Encyclopædia Britannica</cite>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;I was not aware that that
valuable work contained any information respecting Chinese
metaphysics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He read, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Pott, laying his hand on Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
knee, and looking round with a smile of intellectual superiority,
&ldquo;he read for metaphysics under the letter M, and for China under
the letter C, and combined his information, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pott&rsquo;s features assumed so much additional grandeur at the
recollection of the power and research displayed in the learned
effusions in question, that some minutes elapsed before Mr. Pickwick
felt emboldened to renew the conversation; at length, as the
editor&rsquo;s countenance gradually relaxed into its customary expression
of moral supremacy, he ventured to resume the discourse by
asking:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it fair to inquire what great object has brought you so far
from home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That object which actuates and animates me in all my gigantic
labours, sir,&rdquo; replied Pott, with a calm smile; &ldquo;my country&rsquo;s
good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I supposed it was some public mission,&rdquo; observed Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; resumed Pott, &ldquo;it is.&rdquo; Here, bending towards Mr.
Pickwick, he whispered in a deep, hollow voice, &ldquo;A buff ball, sir,
will take place in Birmingham to-morrow evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God bless me!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, and supper,&rdquo; added Pott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so!&rdquo; ejaculated Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>Pott nodded portentously.</p>

<p>Now, although Mr. Pickwick feigned to stand aghast at this
disclosure, he was so little versed in local politics that he was
unable to form an adequate comprehension of the importance
of the dire conspiracy it referred to; observing which, Mr. Pott,
drawing forth the last number of the <cite>Eatanswill Gazette</cite>, and referring
to the same, delivered himself of the following paragraph:</p>


<p class="ttl3">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Hole-and-Corner Buffery.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A reptile contemporary has recently sweltered forth his black
venom in the vain and hopeless attempt of sullying the fair name
of our distinguished and excellent representative, the Honourable
Mr. Slumkey&mdash;that Slumkey whom we, long before he gained his
present noble and exalted position, predicted would one day be,
as he now is, at once his country&rsquo;s brightest honour, and her
proudest boast: alike her bold defender and her honest pride&mdash;our
reptile contemporary, we say, has made himself merry, at the
expense of a superbly embossed plated coal-scuttle, which has been
presented to that glorious man by his enraptured constituents, and
towards the purchase of which, the nameless wretch insinuates,
the Honourable Mr. Slumkey himself contributed, through a confidential
friend of his butler&rsquo;s, more than three-fourths of the whole
sum subscribed. Why, does not the crawling creature see, that
even if this be the fact, the Honourable Mr. Slumkey only appears
in a still more amiable and radiant light than before, if that be
possible? Does not even <em>his</em> obtuseness perceive that this amiable
and touching desire to carry out the wishes of the constituent body,
must for ever endear him to the hearts and souls of such of his
fellow-townsmen as are not worse than swine; or, in other words,
who are not as debased as our contemporary himself? But such is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
the wretched trickery of hole-and-corner Buffery! These are not
its only artifices. Treason is abroad. We boldly state, now that
we are goaded to the disclosure, and we throw ourselves on the
country and its constables for protection&mdash;we boldly state that
secret preparations are at this moment in progress for a Buff ball;
which is to be held in a Buff town, in the very heart and centre of
a Buff population; which is to be conducted by a Buff master of
the ceremonies; which is to be attended by four ultra Buff
members of Parliament, and the admission to which is to be by
Buff tickets! Does our fiendish contemporary wince? Let him
writhe, in impotent malice, as we pen the words, <span class="smcap">We will be
there</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="l4" />

<p>&ldquo;There, sir,&rdquo; said Pott, folding up the paper quite exhausted,
&ldquo;that is the state of the case!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The landlord and waiter entering at the moment with dinner,
caused Mr. Pott to put his finger on his lips, in token that he
considered his life in Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s hands, and depended on
his secrecy. Messrs. Bob Sawyer and Benjamin Allen, who had
irreverently fallen asleep during the reading of the quotation from
the <cite>Eatanswill Gazette</cite>, and the discussion which followed it, were
roused by the mere whispering of the talismanic word &ldquo;Dinner&rdquo; in
their ears: and to dinner they went with good digestion waiting on
appetite, and health on both, and a waiter on all three.</p>

<p>In the course of the dinner and the sitting which succeeded it,
Mr. Pott descending, for a few moments, to domestic topics, informed
Mr. Pickwick that the air of Eatanswill not agreeing with
his lady, she was then engaged in making a tour of different
fashionable watering-places with a view to the recovery of her
wonted health and spirits; this was a delicate veiling of the fact
that Mrs. Pott, acting upon her often-repeated threat of separation,
had, in virtue of an arrangement negotiated by her brother, the
Lieutenant, and concluded by Mr. Pott, permanently retired with
the faithful body-guard upon one moiety or half-part of the annual
income and profits arising from the editorship and sale of the
<cite>Eatanswill Gazette</cite>.</p>

<p>While the great Mr. Pott was dwelling upon this and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
matters, enlivening the conversation from time to time with various
extracts from his own lucubrations, a stern stranger, calling from
the window of a stage-coach, outward bound, which halted at the
inn to deliver packages, requested to know whether, if he stopped
short on his journey and remained there for the night, he could be
furnished with the necessary accommodation of a bed and bedstead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, sir,&rdquo; replied the landlord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can, can I?&rdquo; inquired the stranger, who seemed habitually
suspicious in look and manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt of it, sir,&rdquo; replied the landlord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;Coachman, I get down here.
Guard, my carpet-bag!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bidding the other passengers good night, in a rather snappish
manner, the stranger alighted. He was a shortish gentleman, with
very stiff black hair cut in the porcupine or blacking-brush style,
and standing stiff and straight all over his head; his aspect was
pompous and threatening; his manner was peremptory; his eyes
were sharp and restless; and his whole bearing bespoke a feeling
of great confidence in himself, and a consciousness of immeasurable
superiority over all other people.</p>

<p>This gentleman was shown into the room originally assigned to
the patriotic Mr. Pott; and the waiter remarked, in dumb astonishment
at the singular coincidence, that he had no sooner lighted the
candles than the gentleman, diving into his hat, drew forth a newspaper,
and began to read it with the very same expression of
indignant scorn, which, upon the majestic features of Pott, had
paralysed his energies an hour before. The man observed too, that
whereas Mr. Pott&rsquo;s scorn had been roused by a newspaper headed
the <cite>Eatanswill Independent</cite>, this gentleman&rsquo;s withering contempt
was awakened by a newspaper entitled the <cite>Eatanswill Gazette</cite>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send the landlord,&rdquo; said the stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; rejoined the waiter.</p>

<p>The landlord was sent, and came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you the landlord?&rdquo; inquired the gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am, sir,&rdquo; replied the landlord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know me?&rdquo; demanded the gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not that pleasure, sir,&rdquo; rejoined the landlord.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Slurk,&rdquo; said the gentleman.</p>

<p>The landlord slightly inclined his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slurk, sir,&rdquo; repeated the gentleman, haughtily. &ldquo;Do you
know me now, man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The landlord scratched his head, looked at the ceiling, and at
the stranger, and smiled feebly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know me, man?&rdquo; inquired the stranger, angrily.</p>

<p>The landlord made a strong effort, and at length replied:
&ldquo;Well, sir, I do <em>not</em> know you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great Heaven!&rdquo; said the stranger, dashing his clenched fist
upon the table. &ldquo;And this is popularity!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The landlord took a step or two towards the door; the stranger
fixing his eyes upon him, resumed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;this is gratitude for years of labour
and study in behalf of the masses. I alight wet and weary; no
enthusiastic crowds press forward to greet their champion; the
church-bells are silent; the very name elicits no responsive feeling
in their torpid bosoms. It is enough,&rdquo; said the agitated Mr. Slurk,
pacing to and fro, &ldquo;to curdle the ink in one&rsquo;s pen, and induce one
to abandon their cause for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you say brandy and water, sir?&rdquo; said the landlord, venturing
a hint.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rum,&rdquo; said Mr. Slurk, turning fiercely upon him. &ldquo;Have
you got a fire anywhere?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can light one directly, sir,&rdquo; said the landlord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which will throw out no heat until it is bed-time,&rdquo; interrupted
Mr. Slurk. &ldquo;Is there anybody in the kitchen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not a soul. There was a beautiful fire. Everybody had gone,
and the house door was closed for the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will drink my rum and water,&rdquo; said Mr. Slurk, &ldquo;by the
kitchen fire.&rdquo; So, gathering up his hat and newspaper, he stalked
solemnly behind the landlord to that humble apartment, and
throwing himself on a settle by the fireside, resumed his countenance
of scorn, and began to read and drink in silent dignity.</p>

<p>Now, some demon of discord, flying over the Saracen&rsquo;s Head
at that moment, on casting down his eyes in mere idle curiosity,
happened to behold Slurk established comfortably by the kitchen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
fire, and Pott slightly elevated with wine in another room; upon
which the malicious demon, darting down into the last-mentioned
apartment with inconceivable rapidity, passed at once into the head
of Mr. Bob Sawyer, and prompted him for his (the demon&rsquo;s) own
evil purposes to speak as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, we&rsquo;ve let the fire out. It&rsquo;s uncommonly cold after the
rain, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It really is,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, shivering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad notion to have a cigar by the kitchen
fire, would it?&rdquo; said Bob Sawyer, still prompted by the demon
aforesaid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be particularly comfortable, <em>I</em> think,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Pickwick. &ldquo;Mr. Pott, what do you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pott yielded a ready assent; and all four travellers, each
with his glass in his hand, at once betook themselves to the kitchen,
with Sam Weller heading the procession to show them the way.</p>

<p>The stranger was still reading; he looked up and started. Mr.
Pott started.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; whispered Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That reptile!&rdquo; replied Pott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What reptile?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, looking about him for fear
he should tread on some overgrown black beetle or dropsical spider.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That reptile,&rdquo; whispered Pott, catching Mr. Pickwick by the
arm, and pointing towards the stranger. &ldquo;That reptile Slurk, of
the <cite>Independent</cite>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we had better retire,&rdquo; whispered Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Pott, pot-valiant in a double sense,
&ldquo;never.&rdquo; With these words, Mr. Pott took up his position on
an opposite settle, and selecting one from a little bundle of newspapers
began to read against his enemy.</p>

<p>Mr. Pott, of course, read the <cite>Independent</cite>, and Mr. Slurk, of
course, read the <cite>Gazette</cite>; and each gentleman audibly expressed
his contempt of the other&rsquo;s compositions by bitter laughs and
sarcastic sniffs; whence they proceeded to more open expressions of
opinion, such as &ldquo;absurd,&rdquo; &ldquo;wretched,&rdquo; &ldquo;atrocity,&rdquo; &ldquo;humbug,&rdquo;
&ldquo;knavery,&rdquo; &ldquo;dirt,&rdquo; &ldquo;filth,&rdquo; &ldquo;slime,&rdquo; &ldquo;ditch-water,&rdquo; and other
critical remarks of the like nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>

<p>Both Mr. Bob Sawyer and Mr. Ben Allen had beheld these
symptoms of rivalry and hatred, with a degree of delight which
imparted great additional relish to the cigars at which they were
puffing most vigorously. The moment they began to flag, the
mischievous Mr. Bob Sawyer, addressing Slurk with great politeness,
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you allow me to look at your paper, sir, when you have
quite done with it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will find very little to repay you for your trouble in this
contemptible <em>thing</em>, sir,&rdquo; replied Slurk, bestowing a Satanic frown
on Pott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall have this presently,&rdquo; said Pott, looking up pale with
rage and quivering in his speech from the same cause. &ldquo;Ha! ha!
you will be amused with this <em>fellow&rsquo;s</em> audacity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Terrific emphasis was laid on this &ldquo;thing&rdquo; and &ldquo;fellow;&rdquo; and
the faces of both editors began to glow with defiance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ribaldry of this miserable man is despicably disgusting,&rdquo;
said Pott, pretending to address Bob Sawyer, and scowling upon
Slurk.</p>

<p>Here, Mr. Slurk laughed very heartily, and folding up the paper
so as to get at a fresh column conveniently, said that the blockhead
really amused him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What an impudent blunderer this fellow is,&rdquo; said Pott,
turning from pink to crimson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever read any of this man&rsquo;s foolery, sir?&rdquo; inquired
Slurk, of Bob Sawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; replied Bob; &ldquo;is it very bad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, shocking! shocking!&rdquo; rejoined Slurk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really! Dear me, this is too atrocious!&rdquo; exclaimed Pott, at
this juncture; still feigning to be absorbed in his reading.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you can wade through a few sentences of malice, meanness,
falsehood, perjury, treachery, and cant,&rdquo; said Slurk, handing the
paper to Bob, &ldquo;you will, perhaps, be somewhat repaid by a laugh at
the style of this ungrammatical twaddler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you said, sir?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pott, looking up,
trembling all over with passion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that to you, sir?&rdquo; replied Slurk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ungrammatical twaddler, was it, sir?&rdquo; said Pott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, it was,&rdquo; replied Slurk; &ldquo;and <em>blue bore</em>, sir, if you like
that better; ha! ha!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pott retorted not a word to this jocose insult, but deliberately
folded up his copy of the <cite>Independent</cite>, flattened it carefully
down, crushed it beneath his boot, spat upon it with great
ceremony, and flung it into the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, sir,&rdquo; said Pott, retreating from the stove, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s
the way I would serve the viper who produces it, if I were not,
fortunately for him, restrained by the laws of my country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Serve him so, sir!&rdquo; cried Slurk, starting up. &ldquo;Those laws
shall never be appealed to by him, sir, in such a case. Serve him
so, sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear! hear!&rdquo; said Bob Sawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing can be fairer,&rdquo; observed Mr. Ben Allen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Serve him so, sir!&rdquo; reiterated Slurk, in a loud voice.</p>

<p>Mr. Pott darted a look of contempt, which might have withered
an anchor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Serve him so, sir!&rdquo; reiterated Slurk, in a louder voice than
before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Pott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you won&rsquo;t, won&rsquo;t you, sir?&rdquo; said Mr. Slurk, in a taunting
manner; &ldquo;you hear this, gentlemen! He won&rsquo;t; not that he&rsquo;s
afraid; oh no! he <em>won&rsquo;t</em>. Ha! ha!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I consider you, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Pott, moved by this sarcasm,
&ldquo;I consider you a viper. I look upon you, sir, as a man who has
placed himself beyond the pale of society, by his most audacious,
disgraceful, and abominable public conduct. I view you, sir,
personally and politically, in no other light than as a most unparalleled
and unmitigated viper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The indignant <cite>Independent</cite> did not wait to hear the end of this
personal denunciation; for, catching up his carpet-bag, which was
well stuffed with movables, he swung it in the air as Pott turned
away, and, letting it fall with a circular sweep on his head, just at
that particular angle of the bag where a good thick hair-brush
happened to be packed, caused a sharp crash to be heard throughout
the kitchen and brought him at once to the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; cried Mr. Pickwick, as Pott started up and seized
the fire-shovel, &ldquo;gentlemen! Consider, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake&mdash;help&mdash;Sam&mdash;here&mdash;pray,
gentlemen&mdash;interfere, somebody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uttering these incoherent exclamations, Mr. Pickwick rushed
between the infuriated combatants just in time to receive the
carpet-bag on one side of his body, and the fire-shovel on the
other. Whether the representatives of the public feeling of Eatanswill
were blinded by animosity, or (being both acute reasoners)
saw the advantage of having a third party between them to bear
all the blows, certain it is that they paid not the slightest attention
to Mr. Pickwick, but defying each other with great spirit, plied the
carpet-bag and the fire-shovel most fearlessly. Mr. Pickwick would
unquestionably have suffered severely for his humane interference,
if Mr. Weller, attracted by his master&rsquo;s cries, had not rushed
in at the moment, and, snatching up a meal-sack, effectually
stopped the conflict by drawing it over the head and
shoulders of the mighty Pott, and clasping him tight round the
shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take avay that &rsquo;ere bag from t&rsquo;other madman,&rdquo; said Sam
to Ben Allen and Bob Sawyer, who had done nothing but dodge
round the group, each with a tortoise-shell lancet in his hand,
ready to bleed the first man stunned. &ldquo;Give it up, you wretched
little creetur, or I&rsquo;ll smother you in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Awed by these threats, and quite out of breath, the <cite>Independent</cite>
suffered himself to be disarmed; and Mr. Weller, removing
the extinguisher from Pott, set him free with a caution.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You take yourself off to bed quietly,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll put
you both in it, and let you fight it out vith the mouth tied, as I
vould a dozen sich, if they played these games. And you have
the goodness to come this here vay, sir, if you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus addressing his master, Sam took him by the arm, and led
him off, while the rival editors were severally removed to their beds
by the landlord, under the inspection of Mr. Bob Sawyer and Mr.
Benjamin Allen; breathing, as they went away, many sanguinary
threats, and making vague appointments for mortal combat next
day. When they came to think it over, however, it occurred to
them that they could do it much better in print, so they recommenced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
deadly hostilities without delay; and all Eatanswill rung
with their boldness on paper.</p>

<p>They had taken themselves off in separate coaches, early next
morning, before the other travellers were stirring; and the weather
having now cleared up, the chaise companions once more turned
their faces to London.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Considering</span> it a matter of delicacy to abstain
from introducing either Bob Sawyer or Ben
Allen to the young couple, until they were
fully prepared to expect them, and wishing to
spare Arabella&rsquo;s feelings as much as possible,
Mr. Pickwick proposed that he and Sam should
alight in the neighbourhood of the George and
Vulture, and that the two young men should for the present take
up their quarters elsewhere. To this, they very readily agreed, and
the proposition was accordingly acted upon; Mr. Ben Allen and
Mr. Bob Sawyer betaking themselves to a sequestered pot-shop
on the remotest confines of the Borough, behind the bar-door
of which their names had in other days very often appeared, at
the head of long and complex calculations worked in white chalk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me, Mr. Weller,&rdquo; said the pretty housemaid, meeting
Sam at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear <em>me</em>, I vish it vos, my dear,&rdquo; replied Sam, dropping
behind to let his master get out of hearing. &ldquo;Wot a sweet-looking
creetur you are, Mary!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lor, Mr. Weller, what nonsense you do talk!&rdquo; said Mary.
&ldquo;Oh! <em>don&rsquo;t</em>, Mr. Weller.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t what, my dear?&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that,&rdquo; replied the pretty housemaid. &ldquo;Lor, do get
along with you.&rdquo; Thus admonishing him, the pretty housemaid
pushed Sam against the wall, declaring that he had tumbled her cap,
and put her hair quite out of curl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And prevented what I was going to say, besides,&rdquo; added Mary.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a letter been waiting for you four days; you hadn&rsquo;t
been gone half an hour when it came; and more than that,
it&rsquo;s got &lsquo;Immediate&rsquo; on the outside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vere is it, my love?&rdquo; inquired Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I took care of it for you, or I dare say it would have been lost
long before this,&rdquo; replied Mary. &ldquo;There, take it; it&rsquo;s more than
you deserve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With these words, after many pretty little coquettish doubts and
fears, and wishes that she might not have lost it, Mary produced
the letter from behind the nicest little muslin tucker possible, and
handed it over to Sam, who thereupon kissed it with much gallantry
and devotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My goodness me!&rdquo; said Mary, adjusting the tucker and
feigning unconsciousness, &ldquo;you seem to have grown very fond of
it all at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this Mr. Weller only replied by a wink, the intense meaning
of which no description could convey the faintest idea of; and,
sitting himself down beside Mary on a window seat, opened the
letter and glanced at the contents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; exclaimed Sam, &ldquo;wot&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing the matter, I hope?&rdquo; said Mary, peeping over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless them eyes o&rsquo; yourn!&rdquo; said Sam, looking up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind my eyes; you had much better read your letter,&rdquo;
said the pretty housemaid; and as she said so, she made the eyes
twinkle with such slyness and beauty that they were perfectly
irresistible.</p>

<p>Sam refreshed himself with a kiss, and read as follows:</p>

&ldquo;My dear Sammle,<br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am wery sorry to have the pleasure of bein a Bear of ill news
your Mother in law cort cold consekens of imprudently settin too

</div>

<p>&ldquo;Wot a incomprehensible letter,&rdquo; said Sam; &ldquo;who&rsquo;s to know
wot it means, vith all this he-ing and I-ing! It ain&rsquo;t my father&rsquo;s
writin&rsquo; cept this here signater in print letters; that&rsquo;s his.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he got somebody to write it for him, and signed it
himself afterwards,&rdquo; said the pretty housemaid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop a minit,&rdquo; replied Sam, running over the letter again, and
pausing here and there, to reflect, as he did so. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve hit it.
The gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n as wrote it wos a tellin&rsquo; all about the misfortun&rsquo; in
a proper vay, and then my father comes a lookin&rsquo; over him, and
complicates the whole concern by puttin&rsquo; his oar in. That&rsquo;s
just the wery sort o&rsquo; thing he&rsquo;d do. You&rsquo;re right, Mary, my
dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having satisfied himself on this point, Sam read the letter all
over once more, and, appearing to form a clear notion of its contents
for the first time, ejaculated thoughtfully, as he folded it up:</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so the poor creetur&rsquo;s dead! I&rsquo;m sorry for it. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
warn&rsquo;t a bad disposed &rsquo;ooman, if them shepherds had let her alone.
I&rsquo;m wery sorry for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Weller uttered these words in so serious a manner, that the
pretty housemaid cast down her eyes and looked very grave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hows&rsquo;ever,&rdquo; said Sam, putting the letter in his pocket with
a gentle sigh, &ldquo;it wos to be&mdash;and wos, as the old lady said arter
she&rsquo;d married the footman. Can&rsquo;t be helped now, can it, Mary?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary shook her head, and sighed too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must apply to the hemperor for leave of absence,&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>Mary sighed again. The letter was so very affecting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; rejoined the pretty housemaid, turning her head
away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, shake hands, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>The pretty housemaid put out a hand which, although it was a
housemaid&rsquo;s, was a very small one, and rose to go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be wery long avay,&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re always away,&rdquo; said Mary, giving her head the slightest
possible toss in the air. &ldquo;You no sooner come, Mr. Weller, than
you go again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Weller drew the household beauty closer to him, and entered
upon a whispering conversation, which had not proceeded far, when
she turned her face round and condescended to look at him again.
When they parted, it was somehow or other indispensably necessary
for her to go to her room, and arrange the cap and curls before she
could think of presenting herself to her mistress; which preparatory
ceremony she went off to perform, bestowing many nods and
smiles on Sam over the banisters as she tripped upstairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be avay more than a day, or two, sir, at the farthest,&rdquo;
said Sam, when he had communicated to Mr. Pickwick the intelligence
of his father&rsquo;s loss.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As long as may be necessary, Sam,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick,
&ldquo;you have my full permission to remain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam bowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will tell your father, Sam, that if I can be of any assistance
to him in his present situation, I shall be most willing and ready to
lend him any aid in my power,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Thankee, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Sam. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll mention it, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with some expressions of mutual good-will and interest,
master and man separated.</p>

<p>It was just seven o&rsquo;clock when Samuel Weller, alighting from the
box of a stage-coach which passed through Dorking, stood within
a few hundred yards of the Marquis of Granby. It was a cold,
dull, evening; the little street looked dreary and dismal; and the
mahogany countenance of the noble and gallant Marquis seemed
to wear a more sad and melancholy expression than it was wont to
do, as it swung to and fro, creaking mournfully in the wind. The
blinds were pulled down, and the shutters partly closed; of the
knot of loungers that usually collected about the door, not one was
to be seen; the place was silent and desolate.</p>

<p>Seeing nobody of whom he could ask any preliminary questions,
Sam walked softly in. Glancing round, he quickly recognised his
parent in the distance.</p>

<p>The widower was seated at a small round table in the little room
behind the bar, smoking a pipe, with his eyes intently fixed upon
the fire. The funeral had evidently taken place that day; for
attached to his hat, which he still retained on his head, was a hatband
measuring about a yard and a half in length, which hung
over the top-rail of the chair and streamed negligently down. Mr.
Weller was in a very abstracted and contemplative mood. Notwithstanding
that Sam called him by name several times, he still
continued to smoke with the same fixed and quiet countenance,
and was only roused ultimately by his son&rsquo;s placing the palm of
his hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sammy,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re velcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a callin&rsquo; to you half a dozen times,&rdquo; said Sam,
hanging his hat on a peg, &ldquo;but you didn&rsquo;t hear me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Sammy,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller, again looking thoughtfully
at the fire. &ldquo;I wos in a referee, Sammy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot about?&rdquo; inquired Sam, drawing his chair up to the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a referee, Sammy,&rdquo; replied the elder Mr. Weller, &ldquo;regarding
<em>her</em>, Samivel.&rdquo; Here Mr. Weller jerked his head in the
direction of Dorking churchyard, in mute explanation that his
words referred to the late Mrs. Weller.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I wos a thinkin&rsquo;, Sammy,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, eyeing his son,
with great earnestness, over his pipe; as if to assure him that, however
extraordinary and incredible the declaration might appear, it
was nevertheless calmly and deliberately uttered. &ldquo;I wos a thinkin&rsquo;,
Sammy, that upon the whole I wos wery sorry she wos gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vell, and so you ought to be,&rdquo; replied Sam.</p>

<p>Mr. Weller nodded his acquiescence in the sentiment, and again
fastening his eyes on the fire, shrouded himself in a cloud, and
mused deeply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those wos wery sensible observations as she made, Sammy,&rdquo;
said Mr. Weller, driving the smoke away with his hand, after a long
silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot observations?&rdquo; inquired Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Them as she made, arter she was took ill,&rdquo; replied the old
gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot wos they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somethin&rsquo; to this here effect. &lsquo;Veller,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afeard
I&rsquo;ve not done by you quite wot I ought to have done; you&rsquo;re a
wery kind-hearted man, and I might ha&rsquo; made your home more
comfortabler. I begin to see now,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;ven it&rsquo;s too late, that
if a married &rsquo;ooman vishes to be religious, she should begin vith
dischargin&rsquo; her dooties at home, and makin&rsquo; them as is about her
cheerful and happy, and that vile she goes to church or chapel, or
wot not, at all proper times, she should be wery careful not to conwert
this sort o&rsquo; thing into a excuse for idleness or self-indulgence.
I <em>have</em> done this,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ve wasted time and substance on
them as has done it more than me; but I hope ven I&rsquo;m gone,
Veller, that you&rsquo;ll think on me as I wos afore I know&rsquo;d them people,
and as I raly wos by natur&rsquo;.&rsquo; &lsquo;Susan,&rsquo; says I&mdash;I wos took up wery
short by this, Samivel; I von&rsquo;t deny it, my boy&mdash;&lsquo;Susan,&rsquo; I says,
&lsquo;you&rsquo;ve been a wery good vife to me, altogether; don&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo;
at all about it: keep a good heart, my dear; and you&rsquo;ll live to
see me punch that &rsquo;ere Stiggins&rsquo;s head yet.&rsquo; She smiled at this,
Samivel,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, stifling a sigh with his pipe,
&ldquo;but she died arter all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vell,&rdquo; said Sam, venturing to offer a little homely consolation,
after the lapse of three or four minutes, consumed by the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
gentleman in slowly shaking his head from side to side and
solemnly smoking; &ldquo;vell, gov&rsquo;ner, ve must all come to it, one day
or another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So we must, Sammy,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller the elder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Providence in it all,&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O&rsquo; course there is,&rdquo; replied his father, with a nod of grave
approval. &ldquo;Wot &rsquo;ud become of the undertakers without it,
Sammy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lost in the immense field of conjecture opened by this reflection,
the elder Mr. Weller laid his pipe on the table, and stirred
the fire with a meditative visage.</p>

<p>While the old gentleman was thus engaged, a very buxom-looking
cook, dressed in mourning, who had been bustling about in
the bar, glided into the room, and bestowing many smirks of recognition
upon Sam, silently stationed herself at the back of his
father&rsquo;s chair, and announced her presence by a slight cough; the
which, being disregarded, was followed by a louder one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; said the elder Mr. Weller, dropping the poker as he
looked round, and hastily drew his chair away. &ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s the matter
now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have a cup of tea, there&rsquo;s a good soul,&rdquo; replied the buxom
female, coaxingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I von&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller, in a somewhat boisterous manner,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you&rdquo;&mdash;Mr. Weller hastily checked himself, and added in a
low tone, &ldquo;furder fust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, dear! How adversity does change people!&rdquo; said
the lady, looking upwards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only think &rsquo;twixt this and the doctor as shall change
<em>my</em> condition,&rdquo; muttered Mr. Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really never saw a man so cross,&rdquo; said the buxom female.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind. It&rsquo;s all for my own good; vich is the reflection
vith wich the penitent schoolboy comforted his feelin&rsquo;s ven they
flogged him,&rdquo; rejoined the old gentleman.</p>

<p>The buxom female shook her head with a compassionate and
sympathising air; and, appealing to Sam, inquired whether his
father really ought not to make an effort to keep up, and not give
way to that lowness of spirits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, Mr. Samuel,&rdquo; said the buxom female, &ldquo;as I was telling
him yesterday, he <em>will</em> feel lonely, he can&rsquo;t expect but what he
should, sir, but he should keep up a good heart, because, dear me,
I&rsquo;m sure we all pity his loss, and are ready to do anything for him;
and there&rsquo;s no situation in life so bad, Mr. Samuel, that it can&rsquo;t be
mended. Which is what a very worthy person said to me when my
husband died.&rdquo; Here the speaker, putting her hand before her
mouth, coughed again, and looked affectionately at the elder Mr.
Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I don&rsquo;t rekvire any o&rsquo; your conversation just now, mum,
vill you have the goodness to re-tire?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Weller in
grave and steady voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Weller,&rdquo; said the buxom female, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I only
spoke to you out of kindness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wery likely, mum,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller. &ldquo;Samivel, show the
lady out, and shut the door arter her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This hint was not lost upon the buxom female; for she at once
left the room, and slammed the door behind her, upon which Mr.
Weller senior, falling back in his chair in a violent perspiration,
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sammy, if I was to stop here alone vun veek&mdash;only vun veek,
my boy&mdash;that &rsquo;ere &rsquo;ooman &rsquo;ud marry me by force and wiolence
afore it was over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot! Is she so wery fond on you?&rdquo; inquired Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fond!&rdquo; replied his father, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t keep her avay from me.
If I was locked up in a fire-proof chest vith a patent Brahmin, she&rsquo;d
find means to get at me, Sammy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot a thing it is to be so sought arter!&rdquo; observed Sam,
smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t take no pride out on it, Sammy,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller,
poking the fire vehemently, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a horrid sitiwation. I&rsquo;m actiwally
drove out o&rsquo; house and home by it. The breath was scarcely out
o&rsquo; your poor mother-in-law&rsquo;s body, ven vun old &rsquo;ooman sends me a
pot o&rsquo; jam, and another a pot o&rsquo; jelly, and another brews a blessed
large jug o&rsquo; camomile-tea, vich she brings in vith her own hands.&rdquo;
Mr. Weller paused with an aspect of intense disgust, and, looking
round, added in a whisper: &ldquo;They wos all widders, Sammy, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
on &rsquo;em, &rsquo;cept the camomile-tea vun, as wos a single young lady o&rsquo;
fifty-three.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam gave a comical look in reply, and the old gentleman having
broken an obstinate lump of coal, with a countenance expressive of
as much earnestness and malice as if it had been the head of one
of the widows last mentioned, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;In short, Sammy, I feel that I ain&rsquo;t safe anyveres but on
the box.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you safer there than anyveres else?&rdquo; interrupted
Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cos a coachman&rsquo;s a privileged indiwidual,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Weller, looking fixedly at his son. &ldquo;&rsquo;Cos a coachman may do
vithout suspicion wot other men may not; &rsquo;cos a coachman may
be on the wery amicablest terms with eighty mile o&rsquo; females, and
yet nobody think that he ever means to marry any vun among &rsquo;em.
And wot other man can say the same, Sammy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vell, there&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; in that,&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If your gov&rsquo;ner had been a coachman,&rdquo; reasoned Mr. Weller,
&ldquo;do you suppose as that &rsquo;ere jury &rsquo;ud ever ha&rsquo; conwicted him,
s&rsquo;posin&rsquo; it possible as the matter could ha&rsquo; gone to that extremity?
They dustn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; done it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vy not?&rdquo; said Sam, rather disparagingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vy not!&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Weller; &ldquo;&rsquo;cos it &rsquo;ud ha&rsquo; gone agin
their consciences. A reg&rsquo;lar coachman&rsquo;s a sort o&rsquo; con-nectin&rsquo; link
betwixt singleness and matrimony, and every practicable man
knows it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot! You mean, they&rsquo;re gen&rsquo;ral fav&rsquo;rites, and nobody takes
adwantage on &rsquo;em, p&rsquo;raps?&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>His father nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How it ever come to that &rsquo;ere pass,&rdquo; resumed the parent
Weller, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say. Vy it is that long-stage coachmen possess
such insiniwations, and is alvays looked up to&mdash;a-dored I may say&mdash;by
ev&rsquo;ry young &rsquo;ooman in ev&rsquo;ry town he vurks through, I don&rsquo;t
know. I only know that it is so. It&rsquo;s a reg&rsquo;lation of natur&mdash;a
dispensary, as your poor mother-in-law used to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A dispensation,&rdquo; said Sam, correcting the old gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wery good, Samivel, a dispensation if you like it better,&rdquo; returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
Mr. Weller; &ldquo;<em>I</em> call it a dispensary, and it&rsquo;s alvays writ up
so, at the places vere they gives you physic for nothin&rsquo; in your own
bottles; that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With these words Mr. Weller re-filled and re-lighted his pipe,
and once more summing up a meditative expression of countenance,
continued as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Therefore, my boy, as I do not see the adwisability o&rsquo; stoppin&rsquo;
here to be married vether I vant to or not, and as at the same time
I do not wish to separate myself from them interestin&rsquo; members o&rsquo;
society altogether, I have come to the determination o&rsquo; drivin the
Safety, and puttin&rsquo; up vunce more at the Bell Savage, vich is my
nat&rsquo;ral-born element, Sammy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And wot&rsquo;s to become o&rsquo; the bis&rsquo;ness?&rdquo; inquired Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bis&rsquo;ness, Samivel,&rdquo; replied the old gentleman, &ldquo;good-vill,
stock, and fixters, vill be sold by private contract; and out o&rsquo; the
money, two hundred pound, agreeable to rekvest o&rsquo; your mother-in-law&rsquo;s
to me a little afore she died, vill be inwested in your name
in&mdash;wot do you call them things agin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot things?&rdquo; inquired Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Them things as is alvays a goin&rsquo; up and down, in the City.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Omnibuses?&rdquo; suggested Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller. &ldquo;Them things as is alvays a
fluctooatin&rsquo;, and gettin&rsquo; theirselves inwolved somehow or another
vith the national debt, and the checquers bills, and all that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! the funds,&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Weller, &ldquo;the funs; two hundred pounds
o&rsquo; the money is to be inwested for you, Samivel, in the funs; four
and a half per cent. reduced counsels, Sammy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wery kind o&rsquo; the old lady to think o&rsquo; me,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;m wery much obliged to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The rest vill be inwested in my name,&rdquo; continued the elder
Mr. Weller; &ldquo;and ven I&rsquo;m took off the road, it&rsquo;ll come to you, so
take care you don&rsquo;t spend it all at vunst, my boy, and mind that no
widder gets a inklin&rsquo; o&rsquo; your fortun&rsquo;, or you&rsquo;re done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having delivered this warning, Mr. Weller resumed his pipe
with a more serene countenance; the disclosure of these matters
appearing to have eased his mind considerably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s a tappin&rsquo; at the door,&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em tap,&rdquo; replied his father, with dignity.</p>

<p>Sam acted upon the direction. There was another tap, and
another, and then a long row of taps; upon which Sam inquired
why the tapper was not admitted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; whispered Mr. Weller, with apprehensive looks, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
take no notice on &rsquo;em, Sammy, it&rsquo;s vun o&rsquo; the widders, p&rsquo;raps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No notice being taken of the taps, the unseen visitor, after a
short lapse, ventured to open the door and peep in. It was no
female head that was thrust in at the partially opened door, but
the long black locks and red face of Mr. Stiggins. Mr. Weller&rsquo;s
pipe fell from his hands.</p>

<p>The reverend gentleman gradually opened the door by almost
imperceptible degrees, until the aperture was just wide enough to
admit of the passage of his lank body, when he glided into the
room and closed it after him with great care and gentleness.
Turning towards Sam, and raising his hands and eyes in token of
the unspeakable sorrow with which he regarded the calamity that
had befallen the family, he carried the high-backed chair to his
old corner by the fire, and, seating himself on the very edge,
drew forth a brown pocket-handkerchief, and applied the same to
his optics.</p>

<p>While this was going forward, the elder Mr. Weller sat back in
his chair, with his eyes wide open, his hands planted on his knees,
and his whole countenance expressive of absorbing and overwhelming
astonishment. Sam sat opposite him in perfect silence, waiting,
with eager curiosity, for the termination of the scene.</p>

<p>Mr. Stiggins kept the brown pocket-handkerchief before his eyes
for some minutes, moaning decently meanwhile, and then, mastering
his feelings by a strong effort, put it in his pocket and buttoned it
up. After this he stirred the fire; after that, he rubbed his hands
and looked at Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my young friend,&rdquo; said Mr. Stiggins, breaking the silence
in a very low voice, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a sorrowful affliction!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam nodded very slightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the man of wrath, too!&rdquo; added Mr. Stiggins; &ldquo;it makes
a vessel&rsquo;s heart bleed!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Weller was overheard by his son to murmur something
relative to making a vessel&rsquo;s nose bleed; but Mr. Stiggins heard
him not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know, young man,&rdquo; whispered Mr. Stiggins, drawing
his chair closer to Sam, &ldquo;whether she has left Emanuel anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s he?&rdquo; inquired Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The chapel,&rdquo; replied Mr. Stiggins; &ldquo;our chapel; our fold,
Mr. Samuel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t left the fold nothin&rsquo;, nor the shepherd nothin&rsquo;, nor
the animals nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Sam, decisively; &ldquo;nor the dogs neither.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Stiggins looked slyly at Sam; glanced at the old gentleman,
who was sitting with his eyes closed, as if asleep; and drawing
his chair still nearer, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing for <em>me</em>, Mr. Samuel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s something,&rdquo; said Stiggins, turning as pale as he
could turn. &ldquo;Consider, Mr. Samuel; no little token?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so much as the vorth o&rsquo; that &rsquo;ere old umberella o&rsquo; yourn,&rdquo;
replied Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Mr. Stiggins, hesitatingly, after a few moments&rsquo;
deep thought, &ldquo;perhaps she recommended me to the care of the
man of wrath, Mr. Samuel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s wery likely, from what he said,&rdquo; rejoined Sam;
&ldquo;he wos speakin&rsquo; about you, jist now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was he, though?&rdquo; exclaimed Stiggins, brightening up.
&ldquo;Ah! He&rsquo;s changed, I dare say. We might live very comfortably
together now, Mr. Samuel, eh? I could take care of his property
when you are away&mdash;good care, you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Heaving a long-drawn sigh, Mr. Stiggins paused for a response.
Sam nodded, and Mr. Weller the elder gave vent to an extraordinary
sound, which being neither a groan, nor a grunt, nor a
gasp, nor a growl, seemed to partake in some degree of the character
of all four.</p>

<p>Mr. Stiggins, encouraged by this sound, which he understood to
betoken remorse or repentance, looked about him, rubbed his
hands, wept, smiled, wept again, and then, walking softly across
the room to a well-remembered shelf in one corner, took down a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
tumbler, and with great deliberation put four lumps of sugar in it.
Having got thus far, he looked about him again, and sighed
grievously; with that, he walked softly into the bar, and presently
returning with the tumbler half full of pine-apple rum, advanced
to the kettle which was singing gaily on the hob, mixed his grog,
stirred it, sipped it, sat down, and taking a long and hearty pull at
the rum and water, stopped for breath.</p>

<p>The elder Mr. Weller, who still continued to make various
strange and uncouth attempts to appear asleep, offered not a single
word during these proceedings; but when Stiggins stopped for
breath, he darted upon him, and snatching the tumbler from his
hand, threw the remainder of the rum and water in his face, and
the glass itself into the grate. Then, seizing the reverend gentleman
firmly by the collar, he suddenly fell to kicking him most
furiously: accompanying every application of his top-boots to Mr.
Stiggins&rsquo;s person, with sundry violent and incoherent anathemas
upon his limbs, eyes, and body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sammy,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, &ldquo;put my hat on tight for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam dutifully adjusted the hat with the long hatband more
firmly on his father&rsquo;s head, and the old gentleman, resuming his
kicking with greater agility than before, tumbled with Mr. Stiggins
through the bar, and through the passage, out at the front door,
and so into the street; the kicking continuing the whole way, and
increasing in vehemence, rather than diminishing, every time the
top-boot was lifted.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful and exhilarating sight to see the red-nosed
man writhing in Mr. Weller&rsquo;s grasp, and his whole frame quivering
with anguish as kick followed kick in rapid succession; it was a
still more exciting spectacle to behold Mr. Weller, after a powerful
struggle, immersing Mr. Stiggins&rsquo;s head in a horse-trough full of
water, and holding it there, until he was half suffocated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, throwing all his energy into one
most complicated kick, as he at length permitted Mr. Stiggins to
withdraw his head from the trough, &ldquo;send any vun o&rsquo; them lazy
shepherds here, and I&rsquo;ll pound him to a jelly first, and drownd him
artervards! Sammy, help me in, and fill me a small glass of
brandy. I&rsquo;m out o&rsquo; breath, my boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">When</span> Arabella, after some gentle preparation, and
many assurances that there was not the least
occasion for being low-spirited, was at length
made acquainted by Mr. Pickwick with the unsatisfactory
result of his visit to Birmingham, she
burst into tears, and sobbing aloud, lamented in moving terms
that she should have been the unhappy cause of any estrangement
between a father and his son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear girl,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, kindly, &ldquo;it is no fault of
yours. It was impossible to foresee that the old gentleman would
be so strongly prepossessed against his son&rsquo;s marriage, you know.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
I am sure,&rdquo; added Mr. Pickwick, glancing at her pretty face, &ldquo;he
can have very little idea of the pleasure he denies himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear Mr. Pickwick,&rdquo; said Arabella, &ldquo;what shall we do,
if he continues to be angry with us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, wait patiently, my dear, until he thinks better of it,&rdquo;
replied Mr. Pickwick, cheerfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, dear Mr. Pickwick, what is to become of Nathaniel if
his father withdraws his assistance?&rdquo; urged Arabella.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that case, my love,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;I will venture
to prophesy that he will find some other friend who will not be
backward in helping him to start in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The significance of this reply was not so well disguised by Mr.
Pickwick but that Arabella understood it. So, throwing her arms
round his neck, and kissing him affectionately, she sobbed louder
than before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, taking her hand, &ldquo;we will
wait here a few days longer, and see whether he writes or takes any
other notice of your husband&rsquo;s communication. If not, I have
thought of half a dozen plans, any one of which would make you
happy at once. There, my dear, there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With these words, Mr. Pickwick gently pressed Arabella&rsquo;s hand
and bade her dry her eyes, and not distress her husband. Upon
which, Arabella, who was one of the best little creatures alive, put
her handkerchief in her reticule, and by the time Mr. Winkle joined
them, exhibited in full lustre the same beaming smiles and sparkling
eyes that had originally captivated him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a distressing predicament for these young people,&rdquo;
thought Mr. Pickwick, as he dressed himself next morning. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
walk up to Perker&rsquo;s and consult him about the matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Mr. Pickwick was further prompted to betake himself to
Gray&rsquo;s Inn Square by an anxious desire to come to a pecuniary
settlement with the kind-hearted little attorney without further
delay, he made a hurried breakfast, and executed his intention
so speedily, that ten o&rsquo;clock had not struck when he reached
Gray&rsquo;s Inn.</p>

<p>It still wanted ten minutes to the hour when he had ascended
the staircase on which Perker&rsquo;s chambers were. The clerks had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
not arrived yet, and he beguiled the time by looking out of the
staircase window.</p>

<p>The healthy light of a fine October morning made even the
dingy old houses brighten up a little: some of the dusty windows
actually looking almost cheerful as the sun&rsquo;s rays gleamed upon them.
Clerk after clerk hastened into the square by one or other of the
entrances, and looking up at the Hall clock, accelerated or decreased
his rate of walking according to the time at which his
office hours nominally commenced; the half-past nine o&rsquo;clock
people suddenly becoming very brisk, and the ten o&rsquo;clock gentlemen
falling into a pace of most aristocratic slowness. The clock struck
ten, and clerks poured in faster than ever, each one in a greater
perspiration than his predecessor. The noise of unlocking and
opening doors echoed and re-echoed on every side; heads appeared
as if by magic in every window; the porters took up their
stations for the day; the slipshod laundresses hurried off; the
postman ran from house to house; and the whole legal hive was
in a bustle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re early, Mr. Pickwick,&rdquo; said a voice behind him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Mr. Lowten,&rdquo; replied that gentleman, looking round,
and recognising his old acquaintance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Precious warm walking, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Lowten, drawing a
Bramah key from his pocket, with a small plug therein, to keep the
dust out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You appear to feel it so,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Pickwick, smiling at
the clerk, who was literally red-hot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come along rather, I can tell you,&rdquo; replied Lowten. &ldquo;It
went the half-hour as I came through the Polygon. I&rsquo;m here
before <em>him</em>, though, so I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comforting himself with this reflection, Mr. Lowten extracted
the plug from the door-key, and having opened the door, re-plugged
and re-pocketed his Bramah, and picked up the letters which the
postman had dropped through the box. He then ushered Mr.
Pickwick into the office. Here, in the twinkling of an eye, he
divested himself of his coat, put on a threadbare garment which
he took out of a desk, hung up his hat, pulled forth a few sheets
of cartridge and blotting paper in alternate layers, and sticking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
a pen behind his ear, rubbed his hands with an air of great
satisfaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you see, Mr. Pickwick,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;now I&rsquo;m complete.
I&rsquo;ve got my office coat on, and my pad out, and let him come as
soon as he likes. You haven&rsquo;t got a pinch of snuff about you,
have you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I have not,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for it,&rdquo; said Lowten. &ldquo;Never mind. I&rsquo;ll run out
presently, and get a bottle of soda. Don&rsquo;t I look rather queer
about the eyes, Mr. Pickwick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The individual appealed to, surveyed Mr. Lowten&rsquo;s eyes from a
distance, and expressed his opinion that no unusual queerness was
perceptible in those features.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of it,&rdquo; said Lowten. &ldquo;We were keeping it up pretty
tolerably at the Stump last night, and I&rsquo;m rather out of sorts this
morning. Perker&rsquo;s been about that business of yours, by-the-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What business?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s
costs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; replied Mr. Lowten. &ldquo;About
getting that customer that we paid the ten shillings in the pound
to the bill discounter for, on your account&mdash;to get him out of the
Fleet, you know&mdash;about getting him to Demerara.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! Mr. Jingle?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, hastily. &ldquo;Yes.
Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s all arranged,&rdquo; said Lowten, mending his pen. &ldquo;The
agent at Liverpool said he had been obliged to you many times
when you were in business, and he would be glad to take him on
your recommendation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s well,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;I am delighted to hear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I say,&rdquo; resumed Lowten, scraping the back of the pen
preparatory to making a fresh split, &ldquo;<em>what</em> a soft chap that
other is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which other?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that servant, or friend, or whatever he is; <em>you</em> know;
Trotter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with a smile. &ldquo;I always thought
him the reverse.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, and so did I, from what little I saw of him,&rdquo; replied
Lowten, &ldquo;it only shows how one may be deceived. What do you
think of <em>his</em> going to Demerara, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! And giving up what was offered him here!&rdquo; exclaimed
Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Treating Perker&rsquo;s offer of eighteen bob a-week, and a rise if he
behaved himself, like dirt,&rdquo; replied Lowten. &ldquo;He said he must go
along with the other one, and so they persuaded Perker to write
again, and they&rsquo;ve got him something on the same estate; not near
so good, Perker says, as a convict would get in New South Wales,
if he appeared at his trial in a new suit of clothes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Foolish fellow,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, with glistening eyes.
&ldquo;Foolish fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s worse than foolish; it&rsquo;s downright sneaking, you
know,&rdquo; replied Lowten, nibbing the pen with a contemptuous face.
&ldquo;He says that he&rsquo;s the only friend he ever had, and he&rsquo;s attached
to him, and all that. Friendship&rsquo;s a very good thing in its way:
we are all very friendly and comfortable at the Stump, for instance,
over our grog, where every man pays for himself; but damn
hurting yourself for anybody else, you know! No man should have
more than two attachments&mdash;the first, to number one, and the
second to the ladies; that&rsquo;s what I say&mdash;ha! ha!&rdquo; Mr. Lowten
concluded with a loud laugh, half in jocularity, and half in
derision, which was prematurely cut short by the sound of
Perker&rsquo;s footsteps on the stairs: at the first approach of which
he vaulted on his stool with an agility most remarkable, and
wrote intensely.</p>

<p>The greeting between Mr. Pickwick and his professional adviser
was warm and cordial; the client was scarcely ensconced in the
attorney&rsquo;s arm-chair, however, when a knock was heard at the door,
and a voice inquired whether Mr. Perker was within.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; said Perker, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s one of our vagabond friends&mdash;Jingle
himself, my dear sir. Will you see him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick, hesitating.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think you had better. Here, you sir, what&rsquo;s your name,
walk in, will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In compliance with this unceremonious invitation, Jingle and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
Job walked into the room, but, seeing Mr. Pickwick, stopped short
in some confusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Perker, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know that gentleman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good reason to,&rdquo; replied Mr. Jingle, stepping forward. &ldquo;Mr.
Pickwick&mdash;deepest obligations&mdash;life preserver&mdash;made a man of me&mdash;you
shall never repent it, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am happy to hear you say so,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;You
look much better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks to you, sir&mdash;great change&mdash;Majesty&rsquo;s Fleet&mdash;unwholesome
place&mdash;very,&rdquo; said Jingle, shaking his head. He was decently
and cleanly dressed, and so was Job, who stood bolt upright behind
him, staring at Mr. Pickwick with a visage of iron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When do they go to Liverpool?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick, half
aside to Perker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This evening, sir, at seven o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said Job, taking one step
forward. &ldquo;By the heavy coach from the city, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are your places taken?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are, sir,&rdquo; replied Job.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have fully made up your mind to go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have, sir,&rdquo; answered Job.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With regard to such an outfit as was indispensable for Jingle,&rdquo;
said Perker, addressing Mr. Pickwick aloud, &ldquo;I have taken upon
myself to make an arrangement for the deduction of a small sum
from his quarterly salary, which, being made only for one year, and
regularly remitted, will provide for that expense. I entirely disapprove
of your doing anything for him, my dear sir, which is not
dependent on his own exertions and good conduct.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; interposed Jingle, with great firmness. &ldquo;Clear
head&mdash;man of the world&mdash;quite right&mdash;perfectly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By compounding with his creditor, releasing his clothes from
the pawnbroker&rsquo;s, relieving him in prison, and paying for his
passage,&rdquo; continued Perker, without noticing Jingle&rsquo;s observation,
&ldquo;you have already lost upwards of fifty pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not lost,&rdquo; said Jingle, hastily. &ldquo;Pay it all&mdash;stick to business&mdash;cash
up&mdash;every farthing. Yellow fever perhaps&mdash;can&rsquo;t help that&mdash;if
not&mdash;&rdquo; Here Mr. Jingle paused, and striking the crown of his hat
with great violence, passed his hand over his eyes, and sat down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He means to say,&rdquo; said Job, advancing a few paces, &ldquo;that if
he is not carried off by the fever, he will pay the money back again.
If he lives, he will, Mr. Pickwick. I will see it done. I know he
will, sir,&rdquo; said Job, with energy. &ldquo;I could undertake to swear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, who had been bestowing a
score or two of frowns upon Perker, to stop his summary of
benefits conferred, which the little attorney obstinately disregarded,
&ldquo;you must be careful not to play any more desperate
cricket matches, Mr. Jingle, or to renew your acquaintance with
Sir Thomas Blazo, and I have little doubt of your preserving your
health.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Jingle smiled at this sally, but looked rather foolish notwithstanding;
so Mr. Pickwick changed the subject by saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t happen to know, do you, what has become of
another friend of yours&mdash;a more humble one, whom I saw at
Rochester?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dismal Jemmy?&rdquo; inquired Jingle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jingle shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clever rascal&mdash;queer fellow, hoaxing genius&mdash;Job&rsquo;s brother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Job&rsquo;s brother!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;Well, now I
look at him closely, there <em>is</em> a likeness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were always considered like each other, sir,&rdquo; said Job,
with a cunning look just lurking in the corners of his eyes, &ldquo;only
I was really of a serious nature, and he never was. He emigrated
to America, sir, in consequence of being too much sought after
to be comfortable; and has never been heard of since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That accounts for my not having received the &lsquo;page from the
romance of real life&rsquo; which he promised me one morning when he
appeared to be contemplating suicide on Rochester Bridge, I suppose,&rdquo;
said Mr. Pickwick, smiling. &ldquo;I need not inquire whether
his dismal behaviour was natural or assumed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He could assume anything, sir,&rdquo; said Job. &ldquo;You may consider
yourself very fortunate in having escaped him so easily. On
intimate terms he would have been even more dangerous acquaintance
than&mdash;&rdquo; Job looked at Jingle, hesitated, and finally
added, &ldquo;than&mdash;than&mdash;myself even.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A hopeful family yours, Mr. Trotter,&rdquo; said Perker, sealing a
letter which he had just finished writing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Job. &ldquo;Very much so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the little man, laughing; &ldquo;I hope you are going
to disgrace it. Deliver this letter to the agent when you reach
Liverpool, and let me advise you, gentlemen, not to be too knowing
in the West Indies. If you throw away this chance, you will both
richly deserve to be hanged, as I sincerely trust you will be. And
now you had better leave Mr. Pickwick and me alone, for we have
other matters to talk over, and time is precious.&rdquo; As Perker said
this, he looked towards the door, with an evident desire to render
the leave-taking as brief as possible.</p>

<p>It was brief enough on Mr. Jingle&rsquo;s part. He thanked the little
attorney in a few hurried words for the kindness and promptitude
with which he had rendered his assistance, and, turning to his
benefactor, stood for a few seconds as if irresolute what to say or
how to act. Job Trotter relieved his perplexity; for, with a
humble and grateful bow to Mr. Pickwick, he took his friend gently
by the arm, and led him away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A worthy couple!&rdquo; said Perker, as the door closed behind
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope they may become so,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;What
do you think? Is there any chance of their permanent reformation?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perker shrugged his shoulders doubtfully, but observing Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s anxious and disappointed look, rejoined:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course there is a chance. I hope it may prove a good one.
They are unquestionably penitent now; but then, you know, they
have the recollection of very recent suffering fresh upon them.
What they may become, when that fades away, is a problem that
neither you nor I can solve. However, my dear sir,&rdquo; added Perker,
laying his hand on Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;your object is equally
honourable, whatever the result is. Whether that species of
benevolence which is so very cautious and long-sighted that it is
seldom exercised at all, lest its owner should be imposed upon, and
so wounded in his self-love, be real charity or a worldly counterfeit,
I leave to wiser heads than mine to determine. But if those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
two fellows were to commit a burglary to-morrow, my opinion of
this action would be equally high.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With these remarks, which were delivered in a much more
animated and earnest manner than is usual in legal gentlemen,
Perker drew his chair to his desk, and listened to Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
recital of old Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s obstinacy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give him a week,&rdquo; said Perker, nodding his head prophetically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think he will come round?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think he will,&rdquo; rejoined Perker. &ldquo;If not, we must try the
young lady&rsquo;s persuasion; and that is what anybody but you would
have done first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Perker was taking a pinch of snuff with various grotesque
contractions of countenance, eulogistic of the persuasive powers
appertaining unto young ladies, when the murmur of inquiry
and answer was heard in the outer office, and Lowten tapped at
the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; cried the little man.</p>

<p>The clerk came in, and shut the door after him, with great
mystery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; inquired Perker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wanted, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who wants me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lowten looked at Mr. Pickwick, and coughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who wants me? Can&rsquo;t you speak, Mr. Lowten?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; replied Lowten, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Dodson; and Fogg is with
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless my life!&rdquo; said the little man, looking at his watch. &ldquo;I
appointed them to be here, at half-past eleven, to settle that
matter of yours, Pickwick. I gave them an undertaking on which
they sent down your discharge; it&rsquo;s very awkward, my dear
sir; what will you do? Would you like to step into the next
room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next room being the identical room in which Messrs.
Dodson and Fogg were, Mr. Pickwick replied that he would
remain where he was: the more especially as Messrs. Dodson
and Fogg ought to be ashamed to look him in the face, instead
of his being ashamed to see them. Which latter circumstance he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
begged Mr. Perker to note, with a glowing countenance and many
marks of indignation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, my dear sir, very well,&rdquo; replied Perker. &ldquo;I can only
say that if you expect either Dodson or Fogg to exhibit any
symptom of shame or confusion at having to look you, or anybody
else, in the face, you are the most sanguine man in your expectations
that I ever met with. Show them in, Mr. Lowten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Lowten disappeared with a grin, and immediately returned
ushering in the firm, in due form of precedence: Dodson first,
and Fogg afterwards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have seen Mr. Pickwick, I believe?&rdquo; said Perker to
Dodson, inclining his pen in the direction where that gentleman
was seated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Pickwick?&rdquo; said Dodson in a loud voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; cried Fogg, &ldquo;how do you do, Mr. Pickwick? I
hope you are well, sir. I thought I knew the face,&rdquo; said Fogg,
drawing up a chair and looking round him with a smile.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick bent his head very slightly, in answer to these
salutations, and, seeing Fogg pull a bundle of papers from his
coat-pocket, rose and walked to the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no occasion for Mr. Pickwick to move, Mr. Perker,&rdquo;
said Fogg, untying the red tape which encircled the little bundle,
and smiling again more sweetly than before. &ldquo;Mr. Pickwick is
pretty well acquainted with these proceedings. There are no
secrets between us, I think. He! he! he!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not many, I think,&rdquo; said Dodson. &ldquo;Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo; Then
both the partners laughed together&mdash;pleasantly and cheerfully, as
men who are going to receive money, often do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall make Mr. Pickwick pay for peeping,&rdquo; said Fogg, with
considerable native humour, as he unfolded his papers. &ldquo;The
amount of the taxed costs is one hundred and thirty-three, six,
four, Mr. Perker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a great comparing of papers, and turning over of
leaves, by Fogg and Perker, after this statement of profit and loss.
Meanwhile, Dodson said in an affable manner to Mr. Pickwick:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you are looking quite so stout as when I had the
pleasure of seeing you last, Mr. Pickwick.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Possibly not, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, who had been flashing
forth looks of fierce indignation, without producing the smallest
effect on either of the sharp practitioners; &ldquo;I believe I am not,
sir. I have been persecuted and annoyed by Scoundrels of late, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perker coughed violently, and asked Mr. Pickwick whether he
wouldn&rsquo;t like to look at the morning paper? To which inquiry
Mr. Pickwick returned a most decided negative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Dodson, &ldquo;I dare say you <em>have</em> been annoyed in the
Fleet; there are some odd gentry there. Whereabouts were your
apartments, Mr. Pickwick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My one room,&rdquo; replied that much injured gentleman, &ldquo;was
on the Coffee Room flight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed!&rdquo; said Dodson. &ldquo;I believe that is a very pleasant
part of the establishment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, dryly.</p>

<p>There was a coolness about all this, which, to a gentleman of
an excitable temperament, had, under the circumstances, rather
an exasperating tendency. Mr. Pickwick restrained his wrath
by gigantic efforts; but when Perker wrote a cheque for the
whole amount, and Fogg deposited it in a small pocket-book
with a triumphant smile playing over his pimply features which
communicated itself likewise to the stern countenance of Dodson,
he felt the blood in his cheeks tingling with indignation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Dodson,&rdquo; said Fogg, putting up the pocket-book
and drawing on his gloves, &ldquo;I am at your service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Dodson, rising, &ldquo;I am quite ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very happy,&rdquo; said Fogg, softened by the cheque, &ldquo;to
have had the pleasure of making Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s acquaintance. I
hope you don&rsquo;t think quite so ill of us, Mr. Pickwick, as when we
first had the pleasure of seeing you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; said Dodson, with the high tone of calumniated
virtue. &ldquo;Mr. Pickwick now knows us better, I trust: whatever
your opinion of gentlemen of our profession may be, I beg to
assure you, sir, that I bear no ill-will or vindictive feeling towards
you for the sentiments you thought proper to express in our office
in Freeman&rsquo;s Court, Cornhill, on the occasion to which my partner
has referred.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, no; nor I,&rdquo; said Fogg, in a most forgiving manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our conduct, sir,&rdquo; said Dodson, &ldquo;will speak for itself, and
justify itself, I hope, upon every occasion. We have been in the
profession some years, Mr. Pickwick, and have been honoured
with the confidence of many excellent clients. I wish you good
morning, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Good</em> morning, Mr. Pickwick,&rdquo; said Fogg. So saying, he put
his umbrella under his arm, drew off his right glove, and extended
the hand of reconciliation to that most indignant gentleman: who,
thereupon, thrust his hands beneath his coat tails, and eyed the
attorney with looks of scornful amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lowten!&rdquo; cried Perker at this moment. &ldquo;Open the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait one instant,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;Perker, I <em>will</em> speak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear sir, pray let the matter rest where it is,&rdquo; said the
little attorney, who had been in a state of nervous apprehension
during the whole interview; &ldquo;Mr. Pickwick, I beg!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not be put down, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, hastily.
&ldquo;Mr. Dodson, you have addressed some remarks to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dodson turned round, bent his head meekly, and smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some remarks to me,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Pickwick, almost breathless;
&ldquo;and your partner has tendered me his hand, and you have
both assumed a tone of forgiveness and high-mindedness, which is
an extent of impudence that I was not prepared for, even in you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, sir!&rdquo; exclaimed Dodson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, sir!&rdquo; reiterated Fogg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know that I have been the victim of your plots and
conspiracies?&rdquo; continued Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;Do you know that I am
the man whom you have been imprisoning and robbing? Do you
know that you were the attorneys for the plaintiff, in Bardell and
Pickwick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, we do know it,&rdquo; replied Dodson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we know it, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Fogg, slapping his pocket&mdash;perhaps
by accident.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see that you recollect it with satisfaction,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick,
attempting to call up a sneer for the first time in his life, and
failing most signally in so doing. &ldquo;Although I have long been
anxious to tell you, in plain terms, what my opinion of you is, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
should have let even this opportunity pass, in deference to my
friend Perker&rsquo;s wishes, but for the unwarrantable tone you have
assumed, and your insolent familiarity. I say insolent familiarity,
sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, turning upon Fogg with a fierceness of
gesture which caused that person to retreat towards the door with
great expedition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take care, sir,&rdquo; said Dodson, who, though he was the biggest
man of the party, had prudently intrenched himself behind Fogg,
and was speaking over his head with a very pale face. &ldquo;Let him
assault you, Mr. Fogg; don&rsquo;t return it on any account.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, I won&rsquo;t return it,&rdquo; said Fogg, falling back a little more
as he spoke; to the evident relief of his partner, who by these
means was gradually getting into the outer office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are,&rdquo; continued Mr. Pickwick, resuming the thread of his
discourse, &ldquo;you are a well-matched pair of mean, rascally, pettifogging
robbers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; interposed Perker, &ldquo;is that all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all summed up in that,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Pickwick; &ldquo;they
are mean, rascally, pettifogging robbers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Perker in a most conciliatory tone. &ldquo;My dear
sirs, he has said all he has to say. Now pray go. Lowten, <em>is</em> that
door open?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Lowten, with a distant giggle, replied in the affirmative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, there&mdash;good morning&mdash;good morning&mdash;now pray, my
dear sirs,&mdash;Mr. Lowten, the door!&rdquo; cried the little man, pushing
Dodson and Fogg, nothing loath, out of the office; &ldquo;this way, my
dear sirs,&mdash;now pray don&rsquo;t prolong this&mdash;dear me&mdash;Mr. Lowten&mdash;the
door, sir&mdash;why don&rsquo;t you attend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s law in England, sir,&rdquo; said Dodson, looking towards
Mr. Pickwick, as he put on his hat, &ldquo;you shall smart for this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a couple of <span class="nobreak">mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember, sir, you pay dearly for this,&rdquo; said Fogg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Rascally, pettifogging robbers!&rdquo; continued Mr. Pickwick,
taking not the least notice of the threats that were addressed
to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Robbers!&rdquo; cried Mr. Pickwick, running to the stair-head, as
the two attorneys descended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Robbers!&rdquo; shouted Mr. Pickwick, breaking from Lowten and
Perker and thrusting his head out of the staircase window.</p>

<p>When Mr. Pickwick drew in his head again, his countenance was
smiling and placid; and, walking quietly back into the office, he
declared that he had now removed a great weight from his mind,
and that he felt perfectly comfortable and happy.</p>

<p>Perker said nothing at all until he had emptied his snuff-box,
and sent Lowten out to fill it, when he was seized with a fit of
laughing, which lasted five minutes; at the expiration of which
time he said that he supposed he ought to be very angry, but he
couldn&rsquo;t think of the business seriously yet&mdash;when he could, he
would be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;let me have a settlement
with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of the same kind as the last?&rdquo; inquired Perker, with another
laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Pickwick, drawing out his pocket-book,
and shaking the little man heartily by the hand, &ldquo;I only
mean a pecuniary settlement. You have done me many acts of
kindness that I can never repay, and have no wish to repay, for I
prefer continuing the obligation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this preface, the two friends dived into some very complicated
accounts and vouchers, which, having been duly displayed
and gone through by Perker, were at once discharged by Mr.
Pickwick with many professions of esteem and friendship.</p>

<p>They had no sooner arrived at this point, than a most violent
and startling knocking was heard at the door; it was not an
ordinary double knock, but a constant and uninterrupted succession
of the loudest single raps, as if the knocker were endowed
with the perpetual motion, or the person outside had forgotten to
leave off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; exclaimed Perker, starting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it is a knock at the door,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, as if there
could be the smallest doubt of the fact!</p>

<p>The knocker made a more energetic reply than words could
have yielded, for it continued to hammer with surprising force and
noise, without a moment&rsquo;s cessation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said Perker, ringing the bell, &ldquo;we shall alarm the
Inn. Mr. Lowten, don&rsquo;t you hear a knock?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll answer the door in one moment, sir,&rdquo; replied the clerk.</p>

<p>The knocker appeared to hear the response, and to assert that it
was quite impossible he could wait so long. It made a stupendous
uproar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite dreadful,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, stopping his ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make haste, Mr. Lowten,&rdquo; Perker called out, &ldquo;we shall have
the panels beaten in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Lowten, who was washing his hands in a dark closet, hurried
to the door, and turning the handle, beheld the appearance which
is described in the next chapter.</p>

</div></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> object that presented itself to the eyes of
the astonished clerk was a boy&mdash;a wonderfully
fat boy&mdash;habited as a serving lad, standing
upright on the mat, with his eyes closed as if
in sleep. He had never seen such a fat boy, in
or out of a travelling caravan; and this, coupled
with the calmness and repose of his appearance, so very different
from what was reasonably to have been expected of the inflictor
of the knocks, smote him with wonder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; inquired the clerk.</p>

<p>The extraordinary boy replied not a word; but he nodded once,
and seemed, to the clerk&rsquo;s imagination, to snore feebly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where do you come from?&rdquo; inquired the clerk.</p>

<p>The boy made no sign. He breathed heavily, but in all other
respects was motionless.</p>

<p>The clerk repeated the question thrice, and receiving no answer,
prepared to shut the door, when the boy suddenly opened his
eyes, winked several times, sneezed once, and raised his hand as
if to repeat the knocking. Finding the door open, he stared
about him with astonishment, and at length fixed his eyes on Mr.
Lowten&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the devil do you knock in that way for?&rdquo; inquired the
clerk, angrily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Which way?&rdquo; said the boy, in a slow and sleepy voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, like forty hackney-coachmen,&rdquo; replied the clerk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because master said I wasn&rsquo;t to leave off knocking till they
opened the door, for fear I should go to sleep,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the clerk, &ldquo;what message have you brought?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s down-stairs,&rdquo; rejoined the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master. He wants to know whether you&rsquo;re at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Lowten bethought himself, at this juncture, of looking out
of the window. Seeing an open carriage with a hearty old gentleman
in it, looking up very anxiously, he ventured to beckon him;
on which, the old gentleman jumped out directly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your master in the carriage, I suppose?&rdquo; said Lowten.</p>

<p>The boy nodded.</p>

<p>All further inquiries were superseded by the appearance of old
Wardle, who, running up-stairs and just recognising Lowten, passed
at once into Mr. Perker&rsquo;s room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pickwick!&rdquo; said the old gentleman. &ldquo;Your hand, my boy!
Why have I never heard until the day before yesterday of your
suffering yourself to be cooped up in jail? And why did you
let him do it, Perker?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help it, my dear sir,&rdquo; replied Perker, with a smile
and a pinch of snuff: &ldquo;you know how obstinate he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I do, of course I do,&rdquo; replied the old gentleman.
&ldquo;I am heartily glad to see him, notwithstanding. I will not lose
sight of him again, in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With these words, Wardle shook Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s hand once more,
and having done the same by Perker, threw himself into an arm-chair,
his jolly red face shining again with smiles and health.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Wardle. &ldquo;Here are pretty goings on&mdash;a pinch
of your snuff, Perker, my boy&mdash;never were such times, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mean!&rdquo; replied Wardle. &ldquo;Why, I think the girls are all
running mad; that&rsquo;s no news, you&rsquo;ll say? Perhaps it&rsquo;s not; but
it&rsquo;s true, for all that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have not come up to London, of all places in the world,
to tell us <em>that</em>, my dear sir, have you?&rdquo; inquired Perker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not altogether,&rdquo; replied Wardle; &ldquo;though it was the
main cause of my coming. How&rsquo;s Arabella?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;and will be delighted to
see you, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Black-eyed little jilt!&rdquo; replied Wardle, &ldquo;I had a great idea
of marrying her myself, one of these odd days. But I am glad of
it too, very glad.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="ill13"></a>
<img src="images/ill13.png" width="251" height="335" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>His jolly red face shining with smiles and health</p>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;How did the intelligence reach you?&rdquo; asked Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it came to my girls, of course,&rdquo; replied Wardle. &ldquo;Arabella
wrote, the day before yesterday, to say she had made a stolen
match without her husband&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s consent, and so you had gone
down to get it when his refusing it couldn&rsquo;t prevent the match, and
all the rest of it. I thought it a very good time to say something
serious to <em>my</em> girls; so I said what a dreadful thing it was that
children should marry without their parents&rsquo; consent, and so forth;
but, bless your hearts, I couldn&rsquo;t make the least impression upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
them. They thought it such a much more dreadful thing that
there should have been a wedding without bridesmaids, that I
might as well have preached to Joe himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the old gentleman stopped to laugh; and having done so,
to his heart&rsquo;s content, presently resumed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this is not the best of it, it seems. This is only half the
love-making and plotting that have been going forward. We have
been walking on mines for the last six months, and they&rsquo;re sprung
at last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, turning pale;
&ldquo;no other secret marriage, I hope?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied old Wardle; &ldquo;not so bad as that; no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick; &ldquo;am I interested
in it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I answer that question, Perker?&rdquo; said Wardle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t commit yourself by doing so, my dear sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well then, you are,&rdquo; said Wardle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Mr. Pickwick, anxiously. &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; replied Wardle, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re such a fiery sort of young
fellow that I am almost afraid to tell you; but, however, if Perker
will sit between us to prevent mischief, I&rsquo;ll venture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having closed the room-door, and fortified himself with another
application to Perker&rsquo;s snuff-box, the old gentleman proceeded
with his great disclosure in these words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fact is, that my daughter Bella&mdash;Bella, who married young
Trundle, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, we know,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, impatiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t alarm me at the very beginning. My daughter Bella,
Emily having gone to bed with a headache after she had read
Arabella&rsquo;s letter to me, sat herself down by my side, the other
evening, and began to talk over this marriage affair. &lsquo;Well, pa,&rsquo;
she says, &lsquo;what do you think of it?&rsquo; &lsquo;Why, my dear,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I
suppose it&rsquo;s all very well; I hope it&rsquo;s for the best.&rsquo; I answered in
this way because I was sitting before the fire at the time drinking
my grog rather thoughtfully, and I knew my throwing in an undecided
word now and then, would induce her to continue talking.
Both my girls are pictures of their dear mother, and as I grow old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
I like to sit with only them by me; for their voices and looks carry
me back to the happiest period of my life, and make me, for the
moment, as young as I used to be then, though not quite so light-hearted.
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s quite a marriage of affection, pa,&rsquo; said Bella, after
a short silence. &lsquo;Yes, my dear,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;but such marriages
do not always turn out the happiest.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I question that, mind!&rdquo; interposed Mr. Pickwick, warmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; responded Wardle, &ldquo;question anything you like
when it&rsquo;s your turn to speak, but don&rsquo;t interrupt me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Granted,&rdquo; replied Wardle. &ldquo;&lsquo;I am sorry to hear you express
your opinion against marriages of affection, pa,&rsquo; said Bella,
colouring a little. &lsquo;I was wrong; I ought not to have said so, my
dear, either,&rsquo; said I, patting her cheek as kindly as a rough old
fellow like me could pat it, &lsquo;for your mother&rsquo;s was one, and so
was yours.&rsquo; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not that I meant, pa,&rsquo; said Bella. &lsquo;The fact is,
pa, I wanted to speak to you about Emily.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick started.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo; inquired Wardle, stopping in his
narrative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;Pray go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never could spin out a story,&rdquo; said Wardle, abruptly. &ldquo;It
must come out sooner or later, and it&rsquo;ll save us all a great deal of
time if it comes at once. The long and the short of it is, then,
that Bella at last mustered up courage to tell me that Emily was
very unhappy; that she and your young friend Snodgrass had
been in constant correspondence and communication ever since
last Christmas; that she had very dutifully made up her mind to
run away with him in laudable imitation of her old friend and
schoolfellow; but that having some compunctions of conscience on
the subject, inasmuch as I had always been rather kindly disposed
to both of them, they had thought it better in the first instance
to pay me the compliment of asking whether I would have any
objection to their being married in the usual matter-of-fact manner.
There now, Mr. Pickwick, if you can make it convenient to reduce
your eyes to their usual size again, and to let me hear what you
think we ought to do, I shall feel rather obliged to you!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span></p>

<p>The testy manner in which the hearty old gentleman uttered
this last sentence was not wholly unwarranted; for Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
face had settled down into an expression of blank amazement and
perplexity, quite curious to behold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Snodgrass! Since last Christmas!&rdquo; were the first broken
words that issued from the lips of the confounded gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since last Christmas,&rdquo; replied Wardle; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s plain enough,
and very bad spectacles we must have worn, not to have discovered
it before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, ruminating; &ldquo;I
really cannot understand it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy enough to understand,&rdquo; replied the choleric old
gentleman. &ldquo;If you had been a younger man, you would have
been in the secret long ago; and besides,&rdquo; added Wardle after a
moment&rsquo;s hesitation, &ldquo;the truth is, that, knowing nothing of this
matter, I have rather pressed Emily for four or five months past,
to receive favourably (if she could; I would never attempt to force
a girl&rsquo;s inclinations) the addresses of a young gentleman down in
our neighbourhood. I have no doubt that, girl-like, to enhance
her own value and increase the ardour of Mr. Snodgrass, she has
represented this matter in very glowing colours, and that they have
both arrived at the conclusion that they are a terribly persecuted
pair of unfortunates, and have no resource but clandestine matrimony
or charcoal. Now the question is, what&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have <em>you</em> done?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean, what did you do when your married daughter told
you this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I made a fool of myself of course,&rdquo; rejoined Wardle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; interposed Perker, who had accompanied this
dialogue with sundry twitchings of his watch-chain, vindictive
rubbings of his nose, and other symptoms of impatience. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
very natural; but how?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went into a great passion and frightened my mother into a
fit,&rdquo; said Wardle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was judicious,&rdquo; remarked Perker; &ldquo;and what else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fretted and fumed all next day, and raised a great disturbance,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
rejoined the old gentleman. &ldquo;At last I got tired of
rendering myself unpleasant and making everybody miserable;
so I hired a carriage at Muggleton, and putting my own horses
in it, came up to town, under pretence of bringing Emily to see
Arabella.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Wardle is with you, then?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure she is,&rdquo; replied Wardle. &ldquo;She is at Osborne&rsquo;s
hotel in the Adelphi at this moment, unless your enterprising friend
has run away with her since I came out this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are reconciled, then?&rdquo; said Perker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; answered Wardle; &ldquo;she has been crying and
moping ever since, except last night, between tea and supper, when
she made a great parade of writing a letter that I pretended to
take no notice of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want my advice in this matter, I suppose?&rdquo; said Perker,
looking from the musing face of Mr. Pickwick to the eager countenance
of Wardle, and taking several consecutive pinches of his
favourite stimulant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said Wardle, looking at Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied that gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said Perker, rising and pushing his chair back,
&ldquo;my advice is, that you both walk away together, or ride away, or
get away by some means or other, for I&rsquo;m tired of you, and just
talk this matter over between you. If you have not settled it by
the next time I see you, I&rsquo;ll tell you what to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is satisfactory,&rdquo; said Wardle, hardly knowing whether to
smile or be offended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh, pooh, my dear sir,&rdquo; returned Perker. &ldquo;I know you
both a great deal better than you know yourselves. You have
settled it already, to all intents and purposes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus expressing himself, the little gentleman poked his snuff-box,
first into the chest of Mr. Pickwick, and then into the waistcoat
of Mr. Wardle, upon which they all three laughed, but
especially the two last-named gentlemen, who at once shook hands
again, without any obvious or particular reason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You dine with me to-day,&rdquo; said Wardle to Perker, as he showed
them out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t promise, my dear sir, can&rsquo;t promise,&rdquo; replied Perker.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look in, in the evening, at all events.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall expect you at five,&rdquo; said Wardle. &ldquo;Now, Joe!&rdquo;
And Joe having been at length awakened, the two friends departed
in Mr. Wardle&rsquo;s carriage, which in common humanity had a dickey
behind for the fat boy, who, if there had been a foot-board instead,
would have rolled off and killed himself in his very first nap.</p>

<p>Driving to the George and Vulture, they found that Arabella
and her maid had sent for a hackney-coach immediately on the
receipt of a short note from Emily announcing her arrival in town,
and had proceeded straight to the Adelphi. As Wardle had business
to transact in the city, they sent the carriage and the fat boy
to his hotel, with the information that he and Mr. Pickwick would
return together for dinner at five o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<p>Charged with this message, the fat boy returned, slumbering as
peaceably in his dickey over the stones, as if it had been a down
bed on watch-springs. By some extraordinary miracle he awoke
of his own accord when the coach stopped, and giving himself a
good shake to stir up his faculties, went up-stairs to execute his
commission.</p>

<p>Now whether the shake had jumbled the fat boy&rsquo;s faculties
together, instead of arranging them in proper order, or had roused
such a quantity of new ideas within him as to render him oblivious
of ordinary forms and ceremonies, or (which is also possible) had
proved unsuccessful in preventing his falling asleep as he ascended
the stairs, it is an undoubted fact that he walked into the sitting-room
without previously knocking at the door; and so beheld a
gentleman with his arms clasping his young mistress&rsquo;s waist, sitting
very lovingly by her side on a sofa, while Arabella and her pretty
handmaid feigned to be absorbed in looking out of a window at
the other end of the room. At sight of this phenomenon, the fat
boy uttered an interjection, the ladies a scream, and the gentleman
an oath, almost simultaneously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wretched creature, what do you want here?&rdquo; said the gentleman,
who it is needless to say was Mr. Snodgrass.</p>

<p>To this the fat boy, considerably terrified, briefly responded,
&ldquo;Missis.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want me for?&rdquo; inquired Emily, turning her
head aside, &ldquo;you stupid creature!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master and Mr. Pickwick is a going to dine here at five,&rdquo;
replied the fat boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave the room!&rdquo; said Mr. Snodgrass, glaring upon the
bewildered youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; added Emily hastily. &ldquo;Bella, dear, advise me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon this Emily and Mr. Snodgrass, and Arabella and Mary,
crowded into a corner, and conversed earnestly in whispers for
some minutes, during which the fat boy dozed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; said Arabella, at length, looking round with a most
bewitching smile, &ldquo;how do you do, Joe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; said Emily, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a very good boy; I won&rsquo;t forget
you, Joe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; said Mr. Snodgrass, advancing to the astonished youth,
and seizing his hand, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you before. There&rsquo;s five
shillings for you, Joe!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll owe you five,&rdquo; said Arabella, &ldquo;for old acquaintance&rsquo; sake,
you know;&rdquo; and another most captivating smile was bestowed
upon the corpulent intruder.</p>

<p>The fat boy&rsquo;s perception being slow, he looked rather puzzled
at first to account for this sudden prepossession in his favour, and
stared about him in a very alarming manner. At length his broad
face began to show symptoms of a grin of proportionately broad
dimensions; and then, thrusting half-a-crown into each of his
pockets, and a hand and wrist after it, he burst into a hoarse laugh:
being for the first and only time in his existence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He understands us, I see,&rdquo; said Arabella.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had better have something to eat, immediately,&rdquo; remarked
Emily.</p>

<p>The fat boy almost laughed again when he heard this suggestion.
Mary, after a little more whispering, tripped forth from the group,
and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to dine with you to-day, sir, if you have no
objection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This way,&rdquo; said the fat boy, eagerly. &ldquo;There is such a jolly
meat-pie!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span></p>

<p>With these words, the fat boy led the way down-stairs; his
pretty companion captivating all the waiters and angering all the
chambermaids as she followed him to the eating-room.</p>

<p>There was the meat-pie of which the youth had spoken so
feelingly, and there were, moreover, a steak, and a dish of potatoes,
and a pot of porter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; said the fat boy. &ldquo;Oh my eye, how prime! I
am <em>so</em> hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having apostrophised his eye, in a species of rapture, five or
six times, the youth took the head of the little table, and Mary
seated herself at the bottom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you have some of this?&rdquo; said the fat boy, plunging into
the pie up to the very ferrules of the knife and fork.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little, if you please,&rdquo; replied Mary.</p>

<p>The fat boy assisted Mary to a little, and himself to a great
deal, and was just going to begin eating when he suddenly laid
down his knife and fork, leant forward in his chair, and letting
his hands, with the knife and fork in them, fall on his knees, said,
very slowly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say! How nice you look!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was said in an admiring manner, and was, so far, gratifying;
but still there was enough of the cannibal in the young
gentleman&rsquo;s eyes to render the compliment a double one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me, Joseph,&rdquo; said Mary, affecting to blush, &ldquo;what do
you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fat boy gradually recovering his former position, replied
with a heavy sigh, and remaining thoughtful for a few moments,
drank a long draught of porter. Having achieved this feat he
sighed again, and applied himself assiduously to the pie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a nice young lady Miss Emily is!&rdquo; said Mary, after a
long silence.</p>

<p>The fat boy had by this time finished the pie. He fixed his
eyes on Mary, and replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knows a nicerer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Mary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed!&rdquo; replied the fat boy, with unwonted vivacity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s her name?&rdquo; inquired Mary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s yours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So&rsquo;s hers,&rdquo; said the fat boy. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re her.&rdquo; The boy
grinned to add point to the compliment, and put his eyes into
something between a squint and a cast, which there is reason to
believe he intended for an ogle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t talk to me in that way,&rdquo; said Mary; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t
mean it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I, though?&rdquo; replied the fat boy; &ldquo;I say!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to come here regular?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; rejoined Mary, shaking her head, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going away
to-night. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the fat boy in a tone of strong feeling; &ldquo;how we
should have enjoyed ourselves at meals, if you had been!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might come here sometimes perhaps, to see you,&rdquo; said
Mary, plaiting the table-cloth in assumed coyness, &ldquo;if you would
do me a favour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fat boy looked from the pie-dish to the steak, as if he
thought a favour must be in a manner connected with something
to eat; and then took out one of the half-crowns and glanced at
it nervously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand me?&rdquo; said Mary, looking slyly in his
fat face.</p>

<p>Again he looked at the half-crown, and said faintly, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ladies want you not to say anything to the old gentleman
about the young gentleman having been up-stairs; and I want
you too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; said the fat boy, evidently very much relieved as
he pocketed the half-crown again. &ldquo;Of course I ain&rsquo;t a going to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;Mr. Snodgrass is very fond of Miss
Emily, and Miss Emily&rsquo;s very fond of him, and if you were to tell
about it, the old gentleman would carry you all away miles into
the country, where you&rsquo;d see nobody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, I won&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; said the fat boy, stoutly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a dear,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s time I went up-stairs
and got my lady ready for dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go yet,&rdquo; urged the fat boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must,&rdquo; replied Mary. &ldquo;Good-bye, for the present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fat boy, with elephantine playfulness, stretched out his arms
to ravish a kiss; but as it required no great agility to elude him,
his fair enslaver had vanished before he closed them again; upon
which the apathetic youth ate a pound or so of steak with a sentimental
countenance, and fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>There was so much to say up-stairs, and there were so many
plans to concert for elopement and matrimony in the event of old
Wardle continuing to be cruel, that it wanted only half an hour of
dinner when Mr. Snodgrass took his final adieu. The ladies ran
to Emily&rsquo;s bedroom to dress, and the lover, taking up his hat, walked
out of the room. He had scarcely got outside the door, when he
heard Wardle&rsquo;s voice talking loudly, and looking over the banisters,
beheld him, followed by some other gentlemen, coming straight
up-stairs. Knowing nothing of the house, Mr. Snodgrass in his
confusion stepped hastily back into the room he had just quitted,
and passing from thence into an inner apartment (Mr. Wardle&rsquo;s
bed-chamber), closed the door softly, just as the persons he had
caught a glimpse of entered the sitting-room. These were Mr.
Wardle, Mr. Pickwick, Mr. Nathaniel Winkle, and Mr. Benjamin
Allen, whom he had no difficulty in recognising by their voices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very lucky I had the presence of mind to avoid them,&rdquo; thought
Mr. Snodgrass with a smile, and walking on tiptoe to another door
near the bedside; &ldquo;this opens into the same passage, and I can
walk quietly and comfortably away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was only one obstacle to his walking quietly and comfortably
away, which was that the door was locked and the key gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us have some of your best wine to-day, waiter,&rdquo; said old
Wardle, rubbing his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall have some of the very best, sir,&rdquo; replied the waiter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let the ladies know we have come in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Devoutly and ardently did Mr. Snodgrass wish that the ladies
could know <em>he</em> had come in. He ventured once to whisper
&ldquo;Waiter!&rdquo; through the keyhole, but as the probability of the
wrong waiter coming to his relief flashed upon his mind, together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
with a sense of the strong resemblance between his own situation
and that in which another gentleman had been recently found in a
neighbouring hotel (an account of whose misfortunes had appeared
under the head of &ldquo;Police&rdquo; in that morning&rsquo;s paper), he sat
himself on a portmanteau, and trembled violently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t wait a minute for Perker,&rdquo; said Wardle, looking at
his watch; &ldquo;he is always exact. He will be here in time, if he
means to come; and if he does not, it&rsquo;s of no use waiting. Ha!
Arabella!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My sister!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Benjamin Allen, folding her in a
most romantic embrace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ben dear, how you do smell of tobacco,&rdquo; said Arabella,
rather overcome by this mark of affection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I?&rdquo; said Mr. Benjamin Allen. &ldquo;Do I, Bella? Well,
perhaps I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps he did; having just left a pleasant little smoking party
of twelve medical students, in a small back parlour with a large fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am delighted to see you,&rdquo; said Mr. Ben Allen. &ldquo;Bless
you, Bella!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Arabella, bending forward to kiss her brother;
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t take hold of me again, Ben dear, because you tumble
me so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this point of the reconciliation, Mr. Ben Allen allowed his
feelings and the cigars and porter to overcome him, and looked
round upon the beholders with damp spectacles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is nothing to be said to me?&rdquo; cried Wardle with open arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A great deal,&rdquo; whispered Arabella, as she received the old
gentleman&rsquo;s hearty caress and congratulation. &ldquo;You are a hard-hearted,
unfeeling, cruel monster!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a little rebel,&rdquo; replied Wardle in the same tone, &ldquo;and
I am afraid I shall be obliged to forbid you the house. People like
you, who get married in spite of everybody, ought not to be let
loose on society. But come!&rdquo; added the old gentleman, aloud,
&ldquo;here&rsquo;s the dinner, you shall sit by me. Joe; why, damn the
boy, he&rsquo;s awake!&rdquo;</p>

<p>To the great distress of his master, the fat boy was indeed in
a state of remarkable vigilance; his eyes being wide open, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
looking as if they intended to remain so. There was an alacrity in
his manner, too, which was equally unaccountable; every time his
eyes met those of Emily or Arabella, he smirked and grinned:
once Wardle could have sworn he saw him wink.</p>

<p>This alteration in the fat boy&rsquo;s demeanour originated in his
increased sense of his own importance, and the dignity he acquired
from having been taken into the confidence of the young ladies;
and the smirks, and grins, and winks, were so many condescending
assurances that they might depend upon his fidelity. As these
tokens were rather calculated to awaken suspicion than to allay it,
and were somewhat embarrassing besides, they were occasionally
answered by a frown or shake of the head from Arabella, which
the fat boy considering as hints to be on his guard, expressed his
perfect understanding of, by smirking, grinning, and winking, with
redoubled assiduity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; said Mr. Wardle, after an unsuccessful search in all his
pockets, &ldquo;is my snuff-box on the sofa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied the fat boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I recollect; I left it on my dressing-table this morning,&rdquo;
said Wardle. &ldquo;Run into the next room and fetch it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fat boy went into the next room; and having been absent
about a minute, returned with the snuff-box, and the palest face
that ever a fat boy wore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the boy!&rdquo; exclaimed Wardle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothen&rsquo;s the matter with me,&rdquo; replied Joe, nervously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you been seeing any spirits?&rdquo; inquired the old
gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or taking any?&rdquo; added Ben Allen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; whispered Wardle, across the table.
&ldquo;He is intoxicated, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ben Allen replied that he thought he was; and as that gentleman
had seen a vast deal of the disease in question, Wardle was
confirmed in an impression which had been hovering about his
mind for half an hour, and at once arrived at the conclusion that
the fat boy was drunk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just keep your eye upon him for a few minutes,&rdquo; murmured
Wardle. &ldquo;We shall soon find out whether he is or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>

<p>The unfortunate youth had only interchanged a dozen words
with Mr. Snodgrass: that gentleman having implored him to make
a private appeal to some friend to release him, and then pushed
him out with the snuff-box, lest his prolonged absence should lead
to a discovery. He ruminated a little with a most disturbed
expression of face, and left the room in search of Mary.</p>

<p>But Mary had gone home after dressing her mistress, and the
fat boy came back again more disturbed than before.</p>

<p>Wardle and Mr. Ben Allen exchanged glances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe!&rdquo; said Wardle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you go away
for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fat boy looked hopelessly
in the face of everybody
at table and stammered out
that he didn&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Wardle, &ldquo;you
don&rsquo;t know, eh? Take this
cheese to Mr. Pickwick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Pickwick being
in the very best health and
spirits, had been making himself
perfectly delightful all
dinner-time, and was at this moment engaged in an energetic
conversation with Emily and Mr. Winkle: bowing his head,
courteously, in the emphasis of his discourse, gently waving his
left hand to lend force to his observations, and all glowing with
placid smiles. He took a piece of cheese from the plate, and was
on the point of turning round to renew the conversation, when
the fat boy, stooping so as to bring his head on a level with that
of Mr. Pickwick, pointed with his thumb over his shoulder, and
made the most horrible and hideous face that was ever seen out of
a Christmas pantomime.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p>Pointed with his thumb over
his shoulder</p>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, starting, &ldquo;what a very&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
He stopped, for the fat boy had drawn himself up, and was, or
pretended to be, fast asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; inquired Wardle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is such an extremely singular lad!&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick,
looking uneasily at the boy. &ldquo;It seems an odd thing to
say, but upon my word I am afraid that, at times, he is a little
deranged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! Mr. Pickwick, pray don&rsquo;t say so,&rdquo; cried Emily and
Arabella, both at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not certain, of course,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, amidst profound
silence, and looks of general dismay; &ldquo;but his manner to
me this moment was really very alarming. Oh!&rdquo; ejaculated Mr.
Pickwick, suddenly jumping up with a short scream. &ldquo;I beg your
pardon, ladies, but at that moment he ran some sharp instrument
into my leg. Really he is not safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s drunk,&rdquo; roared old Wardle, passionately. &ldquo;Ring the
bell! Call the waiters! He&rsquo;s drunk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the fat boy, falling on his knees as his master
seized him by the collar. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t drunk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re mad; that&rsquo;s worse. Call the waiters,&rdquo; said the
old gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t mad; I&rsquo;m sensible,&rdquo; rejoined the fat boy, beginning
to cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, what the devil do you run sharp instruments into Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s legs for?&rdquo; inquired Wardle, angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t look at me,&rdquo; replied the boy. &ldquo;I wanted to
speak to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you want to say?&rdquo; asked half a dozen voices at once.</p>

<p>The fat boy gasped, looked at the bedroom door, gasped
again, and wiped two tears away with the knuckle of each of his
forefingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you want to say?&rdquo; demanded Wardle, shaking him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &ldquo;allow me. What did you wish
to communicate to me, my poor boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to whisper to you,&rdquo; replied the fat boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want to bite his ear off, I suppose,&rdquo; said Wardle. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
come near him; he&rsquo;s vicious; ring the bell and let him be taken
down-stairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just as Mr. Winkle caught the bell rope in his hand, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
arrested by a general expression of astonishment; the captive lover,
his face burning with confusion, suddenly walked in from the
bedroom, and made a comprehensive bow to the company.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; cried Wardle, releasing the fat boy&rsquo;s collar, and
staggering back. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been concealed in the next room, sir, since you
returned,&rdquo; explained Mr. Snodgrass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emily, my girl,&rdquo; said Wardle, reproachfully, &ldquo;I detest meanness
and deceit; this is unjustifiable and indelicate in the highest
degree. I don&rsquo;t deserve this at your hands, Emily, indeed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear papa,&rdquo; said Emily, &ldquo;Arabella knows&mdash;everybody here
knows&mdash;Joe knows&mdash;that I was no party to this concealment.
Augustus, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, explain it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Snodgrass, who had only waited for a hearing, at once
recounted how he had been placed in his then distressing predicament;
how the fear of giving rise to domestic dissensions had alone
prompted him to avoid Mr. Wardle on his entrance; how he merely
meant to depart by another door, but, finding it locked, had been
compelled to stay against his will. It was a painful situation to
be placed in; but he now regretted it the less, inasmuch as it
afforded him an opportunity of acknowledging, before their mutual
friends, that he loved Mr. Wardle&rsquo;s daughter, deeply and sincerely;
that he was proud to avow that the feeling was mutual; and that
if thousands of miles were placed between them, or oceans rolled
their waters, he could never for an instant forget those happy days,
when first&mdash;and so on.</p>

<p>Having delivered himself to this effect, Mr. Snodgrass bowed
again, looked into the crown of his hat, and stepped towards
the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; shouted Wardle. &ldquo;Why in the name of all
that&rsquo;<span class="nobreak">s&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Inflammable,&rdquo; mildly suggested Mr. Pickwick, who thought
something worse was coming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;that&rsquo;s inflammable,&rdquo; said Wardle, adopting the substitute,
&ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t you say all this to me in the first instance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or confide in me?&rdquo; added Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear,&rdquo; said Arabella, taking up the defence, &ldquo;what is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
the use of asking all that now, especially when you know you had
set your covetous old heart on a richer son-in-law, and are so
wild and fierce besides, that everybody is afraid of you, except me.
Shake hands with him, and order him some dinner, for goodness
gracious sake, for he looks half-starved; and pray have your wine
up at once, for you&rsquo;ll not be tolerable until you have taken two
bottles at least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The worthy old gentleman pulled Arabella&rsquo;s ear, kissed her
without the smallest scruple, kissed his daughter also with great
affection, and shook Mr. Snodgrass warmly by the hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is right on one point at all events,&rdquo; said the old gentleman,
cheerfully. &ldquo;Ring for the wine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wine came, and Perker came up-stairs at the same moment.
Mr. Snodgrass had dinner at a side table, and, when he had
despatched it, drew his chair next Emily, without the smallest
opposition on the old gentleman&rsquo;s part.</p>

<p>The evening was excellent. Little Mr. Perker came out wonderfully,
told various comic stories, and sang a serious song which was
almost as funny as the anecdotes. Arabella was very charming,
Mr. Wardle very jovial, Mr. Pickwick very harmonious, Mr. Ben
Allen very uproarious, the lovers very silent, Mr. Winkle very
talkative, and all of them very happy.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Samivel</span>,&rdquo; said Mr.
Weller, accosting his
son on the morning
after the funeral,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found it,
Sammy. I thought
it wos there.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Thought vot wos were?&rdquo; inquired Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your mother-in-law&rsquo;s vill, Sammy,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller. &ldquo;In
wirtue o&rsquo; wich, them arrangements is to be made as I told you on,
last night, respectin&rsquo; the funs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot, didn&rsquo;t she tell you vere it wos?&rdquo; inquired Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit on it, Sammy,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller. &ldquo;We wos a
adjestin&rsquo; our little differences, and I wos a cheerin&rsquo; her spirits and
bearin&rsquo; her up, so that I forgot to ask anythin&rsquo; about it. I don&rsquo;t
know as I should ha&rsquo; done it indeed, if I had remembered it,&rdquo;
added Mr. Weller, &ldquo;for it&rsquo;s a rum sort o&rsquo; thing, Sammy, to go a
hankerin&rsquo; arter anybody&rsquo;s property, ven you&rsquo;re assistin&rsquo; &rsquo;em in
illness. It&rsquo;s like helping an outside passenger up, ven he&rsquo;s been
pitched off a coach, and puttin&rsquo; your hand in his pocket, vile you
ask him vith a sigh how he finds hisself, Sammy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this figurative illustration of his meaning, Mr. Weller
unclasped his pocket-book, and drew forth a dirty sheet of letter
paper, on which were inscribed various characters crowded together
in remarkable confusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This here is the dockyment, Sammy,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller. &ldquo;I
found it in the little black teapot, on the top shelf o&rsquo; the bar closet.
She used to keep bank notes there, &lsquo;afore she vos married, Samivel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
I&rsquo;ve seen her take the lid off, to pay a bill, many and many a time.
Poor creetur, she might ha&rsquo; filled all the teapots in the house vith
vills, and not have inconwenienced herself neither, for she took
wery little of anythin&rsquo; in that vay lately, &rsquo;cept on the Temperance
nights, ven they fust laid a foundation o&rsquo; tea to put the spirits
a-top on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does it say?&rdquo; inquired Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jist vot I told you, my boy,&rdquo; rejoined his parent. &ldquo;Two
hundred pound vurth o&rsquo; reduced counsels to my son-in-law,
Samivel, and all the rest o&rsquo; my property, of ev&rsquo;ry kind and description
votsoever to my husband, Mr. Tony Veller, who I appint as
my sole eggzekiter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all, is it?&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller. &ldquo;And I s&rsquo;pose as it&rsquo;s all
right and satisfactory to you and me as is the only parties interested,
ve may as vell put this bit o&rsquo; paper into the fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot are you a-doin&rsquo; on, you lunatic?&rdquo; said Sam, snatching
the paper away, as his parent, in all innocence, stirred the fire
preparatory to suiting the action to the word. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a nice
eggzeketir, you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vy not?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Weller, looking sternly round, with
the poker in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vy not!&rdquo; exclaimed Sam. &ldquo;&rsquo;Cos it must be proved, and
probated, and swore to, and all manner o&rsquo; formalities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that?&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, laying down the
poker.</p>

<p>Sam buttoned the will carefully in a side pocket; intimating
by a look meanwhile, that he did mean it, and very seriously too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll tell you wot it is,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, after a short
meditation, &ldquo;this is a case for that &rsquo;ere confidential pal o&rsquo; the
Chancellorship&rsquo;s. Pell must look into this, Sammy. He&rsquo;s the
man for a difficult question at law. Ve&rsquo;ll have this here brought
afore the Solvent Court directly, Samivel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never did see such a addle-headed old creetur!&rdquo; exclaimed
Sam, irritably, &ldquo;Old Baileys, and Solvent Courts, and alleybis, and
ev&rsquo;ry species o&rsquo; gammon alvays a-runnin&rsquo; through his brain!
You&rsquo;d better get your out o&rsquo; door clothes on, and come to town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
about this bisness, than stand a-preachin&rsquo; there about wot you don&rsquo;t
understand nothin&rsquo; on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wery good, Sammy,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite agreeable
to anythin&rsquo; as vill hexpedite business, Sammy. But mind
this here, my boy, nobody but Pell&mdash;nobody but Pell as a legal
adwiser.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want anybody else,&rdquo; replied Sam. &ldquo;Now are you
a-comin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vait a minute, Sammy,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller, who, having tied
his shawl with the aid of a small glass that hung in the window, was
now, by dint of the most wonderful exertions, struggling into his
upper garments. &ldquo;Vait a minit, Sammy; ven you grow as old as
your father, you von&rsquo;t get into your veskit quite as easy as you do
now, my boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I couldn&rsquo;t get into it easier than that, I&rsquo;m blessed if I&rsquo;d
vear vun at all,&rdquo; rejoined his son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think so now,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, with the gravity of age,
&ldquo;but you&rsquo;ll find that as you get vider, you&rsquo;ll get viser. Vidth and
visdom, Sammy, alvays grows together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Mr. Weller delivered this infallible maxim&mdash;the result of
many years&rsquo; personal experience and observation&mdash;he contrived, by
a dexterous twist of his body, to get the bottom button of his
coat to perform its office. Having paused a few seconds to recover
breath, he brushed his hat with his elbow, and declared himself
ready.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As four heads is better than two, Sammy,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, as
they drove along the London Road in the chaise cart, &ldquo;and as all
this here property is a wery great temptation to a legal gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n,
ve&rsquo;ll take a couple o&rsquo; friends o&rsquo; mine vith us, as&rsquo;ll be wery soon
down upon him if he comes anythin&rsquo; irreg&rsquo;lar; two o&rsquo; them as saw
you to the Fleet that day. They&rsquo;re the wery best judges,&rdquo; added
Mr. Weller in a half whisper, &ldquo;the wery best judges of a horse,
you ever know&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And of a lawyer too?&rdquo; inquired Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man as can form a ackerate judgment of a animal, can
form a ackerate judgment of anythin&rsquo;,&rdquo; replied his father; so
dogmatically, that Sam did not attempt to controvert the position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span></p>

<p>In pursuance of this notable resolution the services of the mottled-faced
gentleman and of two other very fat coachmen&mdash;selected by
Mr. Weller, probably with a view to their width and consequent
wisdom&mdash;were put into requisition; and this assistance having
been secured, the party proceeded to the public-home in Portugal
Street, whence a messenger was despatched to the Insolvent Court
over the way, requiring Mr. Solomon Pell&rsquo;s immediate attendance.</p>

<div class="figright" style="max-width: 250px;"><a id="ill15"></a>
<img src="images/ill15.png" width="250" height="309" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>A cold collation of an Abernethy
biscuit and a saveloy</p>
</div></div>

<p>The messenger fortunately
found Mr. Solomon Pell in
court, regaling himself, business
being rather slack, with
a cold collation of an Abernethy
biscuit and a saveloy.
The message was no sooner
whispered in his ear than he
thrust them in his pocket
among various professional
documents, and hurried over
the way with such alacrity
that he reached the parlour
before the messenger had even
emancipated himself from the
court.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Mr.
Pell, touching his hat, &ldquo;my
service to you all. I don&rsquo;t say
it to flatter you, gentlemen,
but there are not five other
men in the world, that I&rsquo;d have come out of that court for,
to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So busy, eh?&rdquo; said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Busy!&rdquo; replied Pell; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m completely sewn up, as my friend
the late Lord Chancellor many a time used to say to me, gentlemen,
when he came out from hearing appeals in the House of Lords.
Poor fellow! he was very susceptible of fatigue; he used to feel
those appeals uncommonly. I actually thought more than once
that he&rsquo;d have sunk under &rsquo;em; I did indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span></p>

<p>Here Mr. Pell shook his head and paused; on which, the elder
Mr. Weller, nudging his neighbour, as begging him to mark the
attorney&rsquo;s high connections, asked whether the duties in question
produced any permanent ill effects on the constitution of his noble
friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he ever quite recovered them,&rdquo; replied Pell;
&ldquo;in fact I&rsquo;m sure he never did. &lsquo;Pell,&rsquo; he used to say to me many
a time, &lsquo;how the blazes you can stand the head-work you do, is a
mystery to me.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; I used to answer, &lsquo;<em>I</em> hardly know how I
do it, upon my life.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Pell,&rsquo; he&rsquo;d add, sighing, and looking at me
with a little envy&mdash;friendly envy, you know, gentlemen, mere
friendly envy; I never minded it&mdash;&lsquo;Pell, you&rsquo;re a wonder; a
wonder.&rsquo; Ah! you&rsquo;d have liked him very much if you had known
him, gentlemen. Bring me three penn&rsquo;orth of rum, my dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Addressing this latter remark to the waitress in a tone of
subdued grief, Mr. Pell sighed, looked at his shoes, and the ceiling;
and, the rum having by that time arrived, drunk it up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;However,&rdquo; said Pell, drawing a chair to the table, &ldquo;a professional
man has no right to think of his private friendships when
his legal assistance is wanted. By-the-bye, gentlemen, since I saw
you here before, we have had to weep over a very melancholy
occurrence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pell drew out a pocket-handkerchief, when he came to the
word weep, but he made no further use of it than to wipe away a
slight tinge of rum which hung upon his upper lip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw it in the <cite>Advertiser</cite>, Mr. Weller,&rdquo; continued Pell.
&ldquo;Bless my soul, not more than fifty-two! Dear me&mdash;only think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These indications of a musing spirit were addressed to the
mottled-faced man, whose eyes Mr. Pell had accidentally caught;
on which, the mottled-faced man, whose apprehension of matters
in general was of a foggy nature, moved uneasily in his seat, and
opined that indeed, so far as that went, there was no saying how
things <em>was</em> brought about; which observation, involving one of
those subtle propositions which it is so difficult to encounter in
argument, was controverted by nobody.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard it remarked that she was a very fine woman,
Mr. Weller,&rdquo; said Pell in a sympathising manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, she wos,&rdquo; replied the elder Mr. Weller, not much
relishing this mode of discussing the subject, and yet thinking that
the attorney, from his long intimacy with the late Lord Chancellor,
must know best on all matters of polite breeding. &ldquo;She wos a
wery fine &rsquo;ooman, sir, ven I first know&rsquo;d her. She wos a widder
sir, at that time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, it&rsquo;s curious,&rdquo; said Pell, looking round with a sorrowful
smile; &ldquo;Mrs. Pell was a widow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very extraordinary,&rdquo; said the mottled-faced man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it is a curious coincidence,&rdquo; said Pell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; gruffly remarked the elder Mr. Weller. &ldquo;More
widders is married than single wimin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good, very good,&rdquo; said Pell, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re quite right, Mr.
Weller. Mrs. Pell was a very elegant and accomplished woman;
her manners were the theme of universal admiration in our neighbourhood.
I was proud to see that woman dance; there was
something so firm and dignified, and yet natural in her motion.
Her cutting, gentlemen, was simplicity itself. Ah! well, well!
Excuse my asking the question, Mr. Samuel,&rdquo; continued the
attorney in a lower voice, &ldquo;was your mother-in-law tall?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not wery,&rdquo; replied Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Pell was a tall figure,&rdquo; said Pell, &ldquo;a splendid woman, with
a noble shape, and a nose, gentlemen, formed to command and be
majestic. She was very much attached to me&mdash;very much&mdash;highly
connected, too. Her mother&rsquo;s brother, gentlemen, failed for eight
hundred pounds, as a Law Stationer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vell,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, who had grown rather restless during
this discussion, &ldquo;vith regard to bis&rsquo;ness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The word was music to Pell&rsquo;s ears. He had been revolving in
his mind whether any business was to be transacted, or whether he
had been merely invited to partake of a glass of brandy and water,
or a bowl of punch, or any similar professional compliment, and
now the doubt was set at rest without his appearing at all eager for
its solution. His eyes glistened as he laid his hat on the table,
and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the business upon which&mdash;um? Either of these
gentlemen wish to go through the court? We require an arrest;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
a friendly arrest will do, you know; we are all friends here, I
suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me the dockyment, Sammy,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, taking the
will from his son, who appeared to enjoy the interview amazingly.
&ldquo;Wot we rekvire, sir, is a probe o&rsquo; this here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probate, my dear sir, probate,&rdquo; said Pell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller sharply, &ldquo;probe and probe it,
is wery much the same; if you don&rsquo;t understand wot I mean,
sir, I dessay I can find them as does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No offence, I hope, Mr. Weller,&rdquo; said Pell, meekly. &ldquo;You are
the executor, I see,&rdquo; he added, casting his eyes over the paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These other gentlemen, I presume, are legatees, are they?&rdquo;
inquired Pell with a congratulatory smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sammy is a leg-at-ease,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller; &ldquo;these other
gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n is friends o&rsquo; mine, just come to see fair; a kind of
umpires.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Pell, &ldquo;very good. I have no objections, I&rsquo;m sure.
I shall want a matter of five pound of you before I begin, ha!
ha! ha!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It being decided by the committee that the five pound might
be advanced, Mr. Weller produced that sum; after which, a long
consultation about nothing particular took place, in the course
whereof Mr. Pell demonstrated to the perfect satisfaction of the
gentlemen who saw fair, that unless the management of the
business had been entrusted to him, it must all have gone wrong,
for reasons not clearly made out, but no doubt sufficient. This
important point being dispatched, Mr. Pell refreshed himself
with three chops, and liquids both malt and spirituous, at the
expense of the estate, and then they all went away to Doctors&rsquo;
Commons.</p>

<p>The next day, there was another visit to Doctors&rsquo; Commons,
and a great to-do with an attesting hostler, who, being inebriated,
declined swearing anything but profane oaths, to the great scandal
of a proctor and surrogate. Next week, there were more visits to
Doctors&rsquo; Commons, and there was a visit to the Legacy Duty
Office besides, and there were treaties entered into, for the disposal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
of the lease and business, and ratifications of the same, and inventories
to be made out, and lunches to be taken, and dinners to be
eaten, and so many profitable things to be done, and such a mass
of papers accumulated, that Mr. Solomon Pell, and the boy, and
the blue bag to boot, all got so stout that scarcely anybody would
have known them for the same man, boy, and bag, that had
loitered about Portugal Street, a few days before.</p>

<p>At length all these weighty matters being arranged, a day was
fixed for selling out and transferring the stock, and of waiting with
that view upon Wilkins Flasher, Esq., stock-broker, of somewhere
near the Bank, who had been recommended by Mr. Solomon Pell
for the purpose.</p>

<p>It was a kind of festive occasion, and the parties were attired
accordingly. Mr. Weller&rsquo;s tops were newly cleaned and his dress
was arranged with peculiar care; the mottled-faced gentleman
wore at his button-hole a full-sized dahlia with several leaves; and
the coats of his two friends were adorned with nosegays of laurel
and other evergreens. All three were habited in strict holiday
costume; that is to say, they were wrapped up to the chins, and
wore as many clothes as possible, which is, and has been, a stage-coachman&rsquo;s
idea of full dress ever since stage-coaches were invented.</p>

<p>Mr. Pell was waiting at the usual place of meeting at the
appointed time; even Mr. Pell wore a pair of gloves and a clean
shirt much frayed at the collar and wristbands by frequent
washings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A quarter to two,&rdquo; said Pell, looking at the parlour clock.
&ldquo;If we are with Mr. Flasher at a quarter past, we shall just hit
the best time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What should you say to a drop o&rsquo; beer, gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n?&rdquo; suggested
the mottled-faced man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a little bit of cold beef,&rdquo; said the second coachman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or a oyster,&rdquo; added the third, who was a hoarse gentleman
supported by very round legs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; said Pell; &ldquo;to congratulate Mr. Weller, on his
coming into possession of his property: eh? ha! ha!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite agreeable, gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n,&rdquo; answered Mr. Weller.
&ldquo;Sammy, pull the bell.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span></p>

<p>Sam complied; and the porter, cold beef, and oysters being
promptly produced, the lunch was done ample justice to. Where
everybody took so active a part, it is almost invidious to make a
distinction; but if one individual evinced greater powers than
another, it was the coachman with the hoarse voice, who took an
imperial pint of vinegar with his oysters, without betraying the
least emotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pell, sir,&rdquo; said the elder Mr. Weller, stirring a glass of
brandy and water, of which one was placed before every gentleman
when the oyster shells were removed, &ldquo;Mr. Pell, sir, it wos my
intention to have proposed the funs on this occasion, but Samivel
has vispered to <span class="nobreak">me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Here Mr. Samuel Weller, who had silently eaten his oysters with
tranquil smiles, cried &ldquo;Hear!&rdquo; in a very loud voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Has vispered to me,&rdquo; resumed his father, &ldquo;that it vould be
better to dewote the liquor to vishin&rsquo; you success and prosperity,
and thankin&rsquo; you for the manner in which you&rsquo;ve brought this here
business through. Here&rsquo;s your health, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold hard there,&rdquo; interposed the mottled-faced gentleman,
with sudden energy, &ldquo;your eyes on me, gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Saying this, the mottled-faced gentleman rose, as did the other
gentlemen. The mottled-faced gentleman reviewed the company,
and slowly lifted his hand, upon which every man (including him
of the mottled countenance) drew a long breath, and lifted his
tumbler to his lips. In one instant the mottled-faced gentleman
depressed his hand again, and every glass was set down empty.
It is impossible to describe the thrilling effect produced by this
striking ceremony. At once dignified, solemn, and impressive,
it combined every element of grandeur.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Mr. Pell, &ldquo;all I can say is, that such
marks of confidence must be very gratifying to a professional man.
I don&rsquo;t wish to say anything that might appear egotistical, gentlemen,
but I&rsquo;m very glad, for your own sakes, that you came to me;
that&rsquo;s all. If you had gone to any low member of the profession,
it&rsquo;s my firm conviction, and I assure you of it as a fact, that you
would have found yourselves in Queer Street before this. I could
have wished my noble friend had been alive to have seen my management<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
of this case. I don&rsquo;t say it out of pride, but I think&mdash;however,
gentlemen, I won&rsquo;t trouble you with that. I am generally to be
found here, gentlemen, but if I&rsquo;m not here, or over the way, that&rsquo;s
my address. You&rsquo;ll find my terms very cheap and reasonable,
and no man attends more to his clients than I do, and I hope I
know a little of my profession besides. If you have any opportunity
of recommending me to any of your friends, gentlemen, I shall be
very much obliged to you, and so will they too, when they come to
know me. <em>Your</em> healths, gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this expression of his feelings, Mr. Solomon Pell laid three
small written cards before Mr. Weller&rsquo;s friends, and, looking at
the clock again, feared it was time to be walking. Upon this hint
Mr. Weller settled the bill, and, issuing forth, the executor, legatee,
attorney, and umpires, directed their steps towards the City.</p>

<p>The office of Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, of the Stock Exchange,
was in a first floor up a court behind the Bank of England; the
house of Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, was at Brixton, Surrey; the
horse and stanhope of Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, were at an adjacent
livery stable; the groom of Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, was
on his way to the West End to deliver some game; the clerk of
Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, had gone to his dinner, and Wilkins
Flasher, Esquire, himself, cried, &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; when Mr. Pell and his
companions knocked at the counting-house door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, sir,&rdquo; said Pell, bowing obsequiously. &ldquo;We
want to make a little transfer, if you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come in, will you?&rdquo; said Mr. Flasher. &ldquo;Sit down a
minute; I&rsquo;ll attend to you directly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Pell, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no hurry. Take a chair,
Mr. Weller.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Weller took a chair, and Sam took a box, and the umpires
took what they could get, and looked at the almanack and one or
two papers which were wafered against the wall, with as much
open-eyed reverence as if they had been the finest efforts of the
old masters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll bet you half a dozen of claret on it; come!&rdquo; said
Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, resuming the conversation to which Mr.
Pell&rsquo;s entrance had caused a momentary interruption.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span></p>

<p>This was addressed to a very smart young gentleman who wore
his hat on his right whisker, and was lounging over the desk,
killing flies with a ruler. Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, was balancing
himself on two legs of an office stool, spearing a wafer-box with a
pen-knife, which he dropped every now and then with great dexterity
into the very centre of a small red wafer that was stuck
outside. Both gentlemen had very open waistcoats and very rolling
collars, and very small boots, and very big rings, and very little
watches, and very large guard chains, and symmetrical inexpressibles,
and scented pocket-handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never bet half a dozen,&rdquo; said the other gentleman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
take a dozen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Done, Simmery, done!&rdquo; said Wilkins Flasher, Esquire.
&ldquo;P.&nbsp;P., mind,&rdquo; observed the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Wilkins Flasher, Esquire. Wilkins
Flasher, Esquire, entered it in a little book, with a gold pencil-case,
and the other gentleman entered it also, in another little book with
another gold pencil-case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see there&rsquo;s a notice up this morning about Boffer,&rdquo; observed
Mr. Simmery. &ldquo;Poor devil, he&rsquo;s expelled the house!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you ten guineas to five he cuts his throat,&rdquo; said Wilkins
Flasher, Esquire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop! I bar,&rdquo; said Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Perhaps he may hang himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Simmery, pulling out the gold
pencil-case again.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve no objection to take you that way. Say,
makes away with himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kills himself, in fact,&rdquo; said Wilkins Flasher, Esquire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; replied Mr. Simmery, putting down. &ldquo;&lsquo;Flasher&mdash;ten
guineas to five, Boffer kills himself.&rsquo; Within what time shall
we say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fortnight?&rdquo; suggested Wilkins Flasher, Esquire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confound it, no;&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Simmery, stopping for an
instant to smash a fly with the ruler. &ldquo;Say a week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Split the difference,&rdquo; said Wilkins Flasher, Esquire. &ldquo;Make it
ten days.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well; ten days,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Simmery.</p>

<p>So, it was entered down in the little books that Boffer was to kill
himself within ten days, or Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, was to hand
over to Frank Simmery, Esquire, the sum of ten guineas; and that
if Boffer did kill himself within that time, Frank Simmery, Esquire,
would pay to Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, five guineas, instead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry he has failed,&rdquo; said Wilkins Flasher, Esquire.
&ldquo;Capital dinners he gave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine port he had too,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Simmery. &ldquo;We are
going to send our butler to the sale to-morrow, to pick up some of
that sixty-four.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The devil you are,&rdquo; said Wilkins Flasher, Esquire. &ldquo;My
man&rsquo;s going too. Five guineas my man outbids your man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another entry was made in the little books, with the gold pencil-cases;
and Mr. Simmery having, by this time, killed all the flies
and taken all the bets, strolled away to the Stock Exchange to see
what was going forward.</p>

<p>Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, now condescended to receive Mr.
Solomon&rsquo;s Pell&rsquo;s instructions, and having filled up some printed
forms, requested the party to follow him to the Bank: which they
did: Mr. Weller and his three friends staring at all they beheld in
unbounded astonishment, and Sam encountering everything with
a coolness which nothing could disturb.</p>

<p>Crossing a court-yard which was all noise and bustle; and
passing a couple of porters who seemed dressed to match the red
fire-engine which was wheeled away into a corner; they passed
into an office where their business was to be transacted, and where
Pell and Mr. Flasher left them standing for a few moments, while
they went upstairs into the Will Office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot place is this here?&rdquo; whispered the mottled-faced gentleman
to the elder Mr. Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Counsel&rsquo;s Office,&rdquo; replied the executor in a whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot are them gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;men a settin&rsquo; behind the counters?&rdquo;
asked the hoarse coachman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reduced counsels, I s&rsquo;pose,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t they
the reduced counsels, Samivel?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Vy, you don&rsquo;t suppose the reduced counsels is alive, do you?&rdquo;
inquired Sam, with some disdain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; retorted Mr. Weller; &ldquo;I thought they
looked wery like it. Wot are they, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clerks,&rdquo; replied Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot are they all a eatin&rsquo; ham sangwidges for?&rdquo; inquired his
father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cos it&rsquo;s their dooty, I suppose,&rdquo; replied Sam, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a part o&rsquo;
the system; they&rsquo;re always a doin&rsquo; it here, all day long!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Weller and his friends had scarcely had a moment to reflect
upon this singular regulation as connected with the monetary
system of the country, when they were rejoined by Pell and
Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, who led them to a part of the counter
above which was a round black board with a large &ldquo;W.&rdquo; on it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s that for, sir?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Weller, directing Pell&rsquo;s
attention to the target in question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first letter of the name of the deceased,&rdquo; replied Pell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, turning round to the umpires.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; wrong here. We&rsquo;s our letter&mdash;this won&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The referees at once gave it as their decided opinion that the
business could not be legally proceeded with, under the letter W,
and in all probability it would have stood over for one day at least,
had it not been for the prompt, though, at first sight, undutiful
behaviour of Sam, who, seizing his father by the skirt of the coat,
dragged him to the counter, and pinned him there, until he had
affixed his signature to a couple of instruments; which from Mr.
Weller&rsquo;s habit of printing, was a work of so much labour and time,
that the officiating clerk peeled and ate three Ribston pippins
while it was performing.</p>

<p>As the elder Mr. Weller insisted on selling out his portion forthwith,
they proceeded from the Bank to the gate of the Stock
Exchange, to which Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, after a short absence,
returned with a cheque on Smith, Payne, and Smith, for five
hundred and thirty pounds; that being the sum of money to which
Mr. Weller, at the market price of the day, was entitled, in consideration
of the balance of the second Mrs. Weller&rsquo;s funded
savings. Sam&rsquo;s two hundred pounds stood transferred to his name,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
and Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, having been paid his commission,
dropped the money carelessly into his coat pocket and lounged
back to his office.</p>

<p>Mr. Weller was at first obstinately determined on cashing the
cheque in nothing but sovereigns: but it being represented by the
umpires that by so doing he must incur the expense of a small sack
to carry them home in, he consented to receive the amount in
five-pound notes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller as they came out of the banking-house,
&ldquo;my son and me has a wery particular engagement this
arternoon, and I should like to have this here bis&rsquo;ness settled out of
hand, so let&rsquo;s jest go straight avay someveres, vere ve can hordit
the accounts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A quiet room was soon found, and the accounts were produced
and audited. Mr. Pell&rsquo;s bill was taxed by Sam, and some charges
were disallowed by the umpires; but, notwithstanding Mr. Pell&rsquo;s
declaration, accompanied with many solemn asseverations, that they
were really too hard upon him, it was by very many degrees the best
professional job he had ever had, and one on which he boarded,
lodged, and washed, for six months afterwards.</p>

<p>The umpires, having partaken of a dram, shook hands and
departed, as they had to drive out of town that night. Mr.
Solomon Pell, finding that nothing more was going forward, either
in the eating or drinking way, took a friendly leave, and Sam and
his father were left alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, thrusting his pocket-book in his
side pocket. &ldquo;Vith the bills for the lease, and that, there&rsquo;s eleven
hundred and eighty pound here. Now, Samivel, my boy, turn the
horses&rsquo; heads to the George and Wulter!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="stl">An important Conference takes place between Mr. Pickwick and Samuel

</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Mr. Pickwick</span> was sitting alone, musing over
many things, and thinking among other considerations
how he could best provide for the
young couple whose present unsettled condition
was matter of constant regret and anxiety to
him, when Mary stepped lightly into the room,
and, advancing to the table, said, rather hastily:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, if you please, sir, Samuel is down-stairs, and he says may
his father see you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Mary, tripping towards the door again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sam has not been here long, has he?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, sir,&rdquo; replied Mary, eagerly. &ldquo;He has only just come
home. He is not going to ask you for any more leave, sir, he
says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary might have been conscious that she had communicated
this last intelligence with more warmth than seemed actually
necessary, or she might have observed the good-humoured smile
with which Mr. Pickwick regarded her, when she had finished
speaking. She certainly held down her head, and examined the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
corner of a very smart little apron, with more closeness than there
appeared any absolute occasion for.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell them they can come up at once, by all means,&rdquo; said Mr.
Pickwick.</p>

<p>Mary, apparently much relieved, hurried away with her message.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick took two or three turns up and down the room;
and rubbing his chin with his left hand as he did so, appeared lost
in thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick at length, in a kind but somewhat
melancholy tone, &ldquo;it is the best way in which I could reward
him for his attachment and fidelity; let it be so, in Heaven&rsquo;s name.
It is the fate of a lonely old man, that those about him should
form new and different attachments and leave him. I have no
right to expect that it should be otherwise with me. No, no,&rdquo;
added Mr. Pickwick more cheerfully, &ldquo;it would be selfish and
ungrateful. I ought to be happy to have an opportunity of
providing for him so well. I am. Of course I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick had been so absorbed in these reflections, that a
knock at the door was three or four times repeated before he heard
it. Hastily seating himself, and calling up his accustomed pleasant
looks, he gave the required permission, and Sam Weller entered,
followed by his father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glad to see you back again, Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;How
do you do, Mr. Weller?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wery hearty, thankee, sir,&rdquo; replied the widower; &ldquo;hope I
see <em>you</em> well, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite, I thank you,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted to have a little bit o&rsquo; conwersation with you, sir,&rdquo;
said Mr. Weller, &ldquo;if you could spare me five minits or so, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;Sam, give your father a
chair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thankee, Samivel, I&rsquo;ve got a cheer here,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller,
bringing one forward as he spoke; &ldquo;uncommon fine day it&rsquo;s been
sir,&rdquo; added the old gentleman, laying his hat on the floor as he sat
himself down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remarkably so indeed,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;Very seasonable.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Seasonablest veather I ever see, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Weller.
Here, the old gentleman was seized with a violent fit of coughing,
which, being terminated, he nodded his head and winked and made
several supplicatory and threatening gestures to his son, all of
which Sam Weller steadily abstained from seeing.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick, perceiving that there was some embarrassment on
the old gentleman&rsquo;s part, affected to be engaged in cutting the
leaves of a book that lay beside him, and waited patiently until
Mr. Weller should arrive at the object of his visit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never see sich a aggerawatin&rsquo; boy as you are, Samivel,&rdquo; said
Mr. Weller, looking indignantly at his son; &ldquo;never in all my
born days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is he doing, Mr. Weller?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He von&rsquo;t begin, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Weller; &ldquo;he knows I ain&rsquo;t
ekal to ex-pressin&rsquo; myself ven there&rsquo;s anythin&rsquo; partickler to be
done, and yet he&rsquo;ll stand and see me a settin&rsquo; here takin&rsquo; up your
walable time, and makin&rsquo; a reg&rsquo;lar spectacle o&rsquo; myself, rayther than
help me out vith a syllable. It ain&rsquo;t filial conduct, Samivel,&rdquo; said
Mr. Weller, wiping his forehead; &ldquo;wery far from it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You said you&rsquo;d speak,&rdquo; replied Sam; &ldquo;how should I know
you wos done up at the wery beginnin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might ha&rsquo; seen I warn&rsquo;t able to start,&rdquo; rejoined his father;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on the wrong side of the road, and backin&rsquo; into the palin&rsquo;s,
and all manner of unpleasantness, and yet you von&rsquo;t put out a
hand to help me. I&rsquo;m ashamed on you, Samivel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fact is, sir,&rdquo; said Sam, with a slight bow, &ldquo;the gov&rsquo;ner&rsquo;s
been a drawin&rsquo; his money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wery good, Samivel, wery good,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, nodding his
head with a satisfied air, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to speak harsh to you,
Sammy. Wery good. That&rsquo;s the vay to begin. Come to the
pint at once. Wery good indeed, Samivel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Weller nodded his head an extraordinary number of times,
in the excess of his gratification, and waited in a listening attitude
for Sam to resume his statement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may sit down, Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, apprehending
that the interview was likely to prove rather longer than he had
expected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span></p>

<p>Sam bowed again and sat down; his father looking round, he
continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gov&rsquo;ner, sir, has drawn out five hundred and thirty
pound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reduced counsels,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Weller senior, in an
undertone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t much matter vether it&rsquo;s reduced counsels, or wot
not,&rdquo; said Sam; &ldquo;five hundred and thirty pound is the sum,
ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Samivel,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To vich sum, he has added for the house and bis&rsquo;<span class="nobreak">ness&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Lease, good-vill, stock, and fixters,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Weller.</p>

<p>&mdash;&ldquo;As much as makes it,&rdquo; continued Sam, &ldquo;altogether, eleven
hundred and eighty pound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;I am delighted to hear it. I
congratulate you, Mr. Weller, on having done so well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vait a minit, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, raising his hand in a
deprecatory manner. &ldquo;Get on, Samivel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This here money,&rdquo; said Sam, with a little hesitation, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
anxious to put someveres, vere he knows it&rsquo;ll be safe, and I&rsquo;m wery
anxious too, for if he keeps it, he&rsquo;ll go a lendin&rsquo; it to somebody, or
inwestin&rsquo; property in horses, or droppin&rsquo; his pocket-book down a
airy, or makin&rsquo; a Egyptian mummy of his-self in some vay or
another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wery good, Samivel,&rdquo; observed Mr. Weller, in as complacent
a manner as if Sam had been passing the highest eulogiums on his
prudence and foresight. &ldquo;Wery good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For vich reasons,&rdquo; continued Sam, plucking nervously at the
brim of his hat; &ldquo;for vich reasons, he&rsquo;s drawed it out to-day, and
come here vith me to say, leastvays to offer, or in other vords
<span class="nobreak">to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;To say this here,&rdquo; said the elder Mr. Weller, impatiently,
&ldquo;that it ain&rsquo;t no use to me. I&rsquo;m a goin&rsquo; to vork a coach reg&rsquo;lar,
and han&rsquo;t got noveres to keep it in, unless I vos to pay the guard
for takin&rsquo; care on it, or to put it in vun o&rsquo; the coach pockets, vich
&rsquo;ud be a temptation to the insides. If you&rsquo;ll take care on it for me,
sir, I shall be wery much obliged to you. P&rsquo;raps,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
walking up to Mr. Pickwick and whispering in his ear, &ldquo;p&rsquo;raps it&rsquo;ll
go a little vay towards the expenses o&rsquo; that &rsquo;ere conwiction. All
I say is, just you keep it till I ask you for it again.&rdquo; With these
words, Mr. Weller placed the pocket-book in Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s hands,
caught up his hat, and ran out of the room with a celerity scarcely
to be expected from so corpulent a subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop him, Sam!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, earnestly.
&ldquo;Overtake him; bring him back instantly! Mr. Weller&mdash;here&mdash;come
back!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam saw that his master&rsquo;s injunctions were not to be disobeyed;
and catching his father by the arm as he was descending the stairs,
dragged him back by main force.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My good friend,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, taking the old man by
the hand, &ldquo;your honest confidence overpowers me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see no occasion for nothin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the kind, sir,&rdquo; replied
Mr. Weller, obstinately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I assure you, my good friend, I have more money than I can
ever need; far more than a man at my age can ever live to spend,&rdquo;
said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No man knows how much he can spend, till he tries,&rdquo; observed
Mr. Weller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick; &ldquo;but as I have no intention
of trying any such experiments, I am not likely to come
to want. I must beg you to take this back, Mr. Weller.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wery well,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller with a discontented look. &ldquo;Mark
my vords, Sammy. I&rsquo;ll do something desperate vith this here
property; somethin&rsquo; desperate!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better not,&rdquo; replied Sam.</p>

<p>Mr. Weller reflected for a short time, and then, buttoning up
his coat with great determination, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep a pike.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot!&rdquo; exclaimed Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pike,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Weller, through his set teeth: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
keep a pike. Say good-bye to your father, Samivel. I devote the
remainder o&rsquo; my days to&rsquo; a pike.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This threat was such an awful one, and Mr. Weller, besides
appearing fully resolved to carry it into execution, seemed so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
deeply mortified by Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s refusal, that that gentleman
after a short reflection, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, Mr. Weller, I will keep the money. I can do more
good with it, perhaps, than you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just the wery thing, to be sure,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, brightening
up; &ldquo;o&rsquo; course you can, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say no more about it,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, locking the pocket-book
in his desk; &ldquo;I am heartily obliged to you, my good friend.
Now sit down again. I want to ask your advice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The internal laughter occasioned by the triumphant success of
his visit, which had convulsed not only Mr. Weller&rsquo;s face, but his
arms, legs, and body also, during the locking up of the pocket-book,
suddenly gave place to the most dignified gravity as he
heard these words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait outside a few minutes, Sam, will you?&rdquo; said Mr.
Pickwick.</p>

<p>Sam immediately withdrew.</p>

<p>Mr. Weller looked uncommonly wise and very much amazed,
when Mr. Pickwick opened the discourse by saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not an advocate for matrimony, I think, Mr.
Weller?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Weller shook his head. He was wholly unable to speak;
vague thoughts of some wicked widow having been successful in
her designs on Mr. Pickwick, choked his utterance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you happen to see a young girl down-stairs when you came
in just now with your son?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I see a young gal,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller, shortly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you think of her, now? Candidly, Mr. Weller,
what did you think of her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought she wos wery plump, and vell made,&rdquo; said Mr.
Weller, with a critical air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So she is,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;so she is. What did you think
of her manners, from what you saw of her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wery pleasant,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Weller. &ldquo;Wery pleasant and
conformable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The precise meaning which Mr. Weller attached to this last-mentioned
adjective did not appear; but, as it was evident from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
the tone in which he used it that it was a favourable expression,
Mr. Pickwick was as well satisfied as if he had been thoroughly
enlightened on the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I take a great interest in her, Mr. Weller,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>Mr. Weller coughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean an interest in her doing well,&rdquo; resumed Mr. Pickwick;
&ldquo;a desire that she may be comfortable and prosperous. You
understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wery clearly,&rdquo; replied Mr. Weller, who understood nothing
yet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That young person,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;is attached to
your son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Samivel Veller!&rdquo; exclaimed the parent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nat&rsquo;ral,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, after some consideration,
&ldquo;nat&rsquo;ral, but rather alarmin&rsquo;. Sammy must be careful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wery careful that he don&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo; to her,&rdquo; responded
Mr. Weller. &ldquo;Wery careful that he ain&rsquo;t led avay, in a innocent
moment, to say anythink as may lead to a conwiction for breach.
You&rsquo;re never safe vith &rsquo;em, Mr. Pickwick, ven they vunce has
designs on you; there&rsquo;s no knowin&rsquo; vere to have &rsquo;em; and vile
you&rsquo;re a considering of it, they have you. I wos married fust
that vay myself, sir, and Sammy was the consekens o&rsquo; the
manoover.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You give me no great encouragement to conclude what I have
to say,&rdquo; observed Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;but I had better do so at once.
This young person is not only attached to your son, Mr. Weller, but
your son is attached to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vell,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, &ldquo;this here&rsquo;s a pretty sort o&rsquo; thing to
come to a father&rsquo;s ears, this is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have observed them on several occasions,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick,
making no comment on Mr. Weller&rsquo;s last remark; &ldquo;and entertain
no doubt at all about it. Supposing I were desirous of establishing
them comfortably as man and wife in some little business or situation,
where they might hope to obtain a decent living, what should
you think of it, Mr. Weller?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span></p>

<p>At first Mr. Weller received with wry faces a proposition involving
the marriage of anybody in whom he took an interest; but,
as Mr. Pickwick argued the point with him, and laid great stress
on the fact that Mary was not a widow, he gradually became more
tractable. Mr. Pickwick had great influence over him, and he had
been much struck with Mary&rsquo;s appearance; having, in fact, bestowed
several very unfatherly winks upon her, already. At length
he said that it was not for him to oppose Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s inclination,
and that he would be very happy to yield to his advice; upon which
Mr. Pickwick joyfully took him at his word, and called Sam back
into the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, clearing his throat, &ldquo;your father and
I have been having some conversation about you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About you, Samivel,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, in a patronising and
impressive voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not so blind, Sam, as not to have seen, a long time since,
that you entertain something more than a friendly feeling towards
Mrs. Winkle&rsquo;s maid,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You hear this, Samivel?&rdquo; said Mr. Weller in the same judicial
form of speech as before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope, sir,&rdquo; said Sam, addressing his master: &ldquo;I hope there&rsquo;s
no harm in a young man takin&rsquo; notice of a young &rsquo;ooman as is
undeniably good-looking and well-conducted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not by no means,&rdquo; acquiesced Mr. Weller, affably but
magisterially.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So far from thinking there is anything wrong, in conduct so
natural,&rdquo; resumed Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;it is my wish to assist and promote
your wishes in this respect. With this view, I have had a
little conversation with your father; and finding that he is of my
<span class="nobreak">opinion&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The lady not bein&rsquo; a widder,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Weller in
explanation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lady not being a widow,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, smiling. &ldquo;I
wish to free you from the restraint which your present position
imposes upon you, and to mark my sense of your fidelity and many
excellent qualities, by enabling you to marry this girl at once, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
to earn an independent livelihood for yourself and family. I shall
be proud, Sam,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, whose voice had faltered a little
hitherto, but now resumed its customary tone, &ldquo;proud and happy to
make your future prospects in life, my grateful and peculiar care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a profound silence for a short time, and then Sam
said in a low husky sort of voice, but firmly withal:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very much obliged to you for your goodness, sir, as is only
like yourself; but it can&rsquo;t be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be done!&rdquo; ejaculated Mr. Pickwick in astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Samivel!&rdquo; said Mr. Weller, with dignity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say it can&rsquo;t be done,&rdquo; repeated Sam in a louder key. &ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s
to become of you, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My good fellow,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;the recent changes
among my friends will alter my mode of life in future, entirely;
besides, I am growing older, and want repose and quiet. My
rambles, Sam, are over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do I know that &rsquo;ere, sir?&rdquo; argued Sam. &ldquo;You think so
now! S&rsquo;pose you wos to change your mind, vich is not unlikely,
for you&rsquo;ve the spirit o&rsquo; five-and tventy in you still, what &rsquo;ud become
on you vithout me? It can&rsquo;t be done, sir, it can&rsquo;t be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wery good, Samivel, there&rsquo;s a good deal in that,&rdquo; said Mr.
Weller, encouragingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I speak after long deliberation, Sam, and with the certainty
that I shall keep my word,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, shaking his head.
&ldquo;New scenes have closed upon me; my rambles are at an end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wery good,&rdquo; rejoined Sam. &ldquo;Then, that&rsquo;s the wery best
reason vy you should alvays have somebody by you as understands
you, to keep you up and make you comfortable. If you vant a more
polished sort o&rsquo; feller, vell and good, have him; but vages or no
vages, notice or no notice, board or no board, lodgin&rsquo; or no lodgin&rsquo;,
Sam Veller, as you took from the old inn in the Borough, sticks by
you, come what come may; and let ev&rsquo;rythin&rsquo; and ev&rsquo;rybody do
their wery fiercest, nothin&rsquo; shall ever perwent it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the close of this declaration, which Sam made with great
emotion, the elder Mr. Weller rose from his chair, and, forgetting
all considerations of time, place, or propriety, waved his hat above
his head, and gave three vehement cheers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My good fellow,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, when Mr. Weller had sat
down again, rather abashed at his own enthusiasm, &ldquo;you are bound
to consider the young woman also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do consider the young &rsquo;ooman, sir,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;I have considered
the young &rsquo;ooman. I&rsquo;ve spoke to her. I&rsquo;ve told her how
I&rsquo;m sitivated; she&rsquo;s ready to wait till I&rsquo;m ready, and I believe she
vill. If she don&rsquo;t, she&rsquo;s not the young &rsquo;ooman I take her for, and
I give her up vith readiness. You&rsquo;ve know&rsquo;d me afore, sir. My
mind&rsquo;s made up, and nothin&rsquo; can ever alter it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Who could combat this resolution? Not Mr. Pickwick. He
derived, at that moment, more pride and luxury of feeling from
the disinterested attachment of his humble friends, than ten
thousand protestations from the greatest men living could have
awakened in his heart.</p>

<p>While this conversation was passing in Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s room, a
little old gentleman in a suit of snuff-coloured clothes, followed by
a porter carrying a small portmanteau, presented himself below;
and after securing a bed for the night, inquired of the waiter whether
one Mrs. Winkle was staying there, to which question the waiter,
of course, responded in the affirmative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she alone?&rdquo; inquired the little old gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe she is, sir,&rdquo; replied the waiter; &ldquo;I can call her own
maid, sir, if <span class="nobreak">you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t want her,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, quickly.
&ldquo;Show me to her room without announcing me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh, sir?&rdquo; said the waiter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you deaf?&rdquo; inquired the little old gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then listen, if you please. Can you hear me now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s well. Show me to Mrs. Winkle&rsquo;s room, without
announcing me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the little old gentleman uttered this command, he slipped
five shillings into the waiter&rsquo;s hand, and looked steadily at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, sir,&rdquo; said the waiter, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir, <span class="nobreak">whether&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! you&rsquo;ll do it, I see,&rdquo; said the little old gentleman. &ldquo;You
had better do it at once. It will save time.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span></p>

<p>There was something so very cool and collected in the gentleman&rsquo;s
manner, that the waiter put the five shillings in his pocket,
and led him up-stairs without a word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the room, is it?&rdquo; said the gentleman. &ldquo;You may go.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="ill16"></a>
<img src="images/ill16.png" width="483" height="382" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>A little old gentleman in a suit of snuff-coloured clothes</p>
</div></div>

<p>The waiter complied, wondering much who the gentleman
could be and what he wanted; the little old gentleman, waiting
till he was out of sight, tapped at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said Arabella.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um! a pretty voice at any rate,&rdquo; murmured the little old
gentleman; &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo; As he said this he opened the
door and walked in. Arabella, who was sitting at work, rose
on beholding a stranger&mdash;a little confused&mdash;but by no means
ungracefully so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t rise, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the unknown, walking in, and
closing the door after him. &ldquo;Mrs. Winkle, I believe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arabella inclined her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Nathaniel Winkle, who married the son of the old man
at Birmingham?&rdquo; said the stranger, eyeing Arabella with visible
curiosity.</p>

<p>Again Arabella inclined her head, and looked uneasily round as
if uncertain whether to call for assistance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I surprise you, I see, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the old gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather, I confess,&rdquo; replied Arabella, wondering more and
more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a chair, if you&rsquo;ll allow me, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the stranger.</p>

<p>He took one, and drawing a spectacle-case from his pocket,
leisurely pulled out a pair of spectacles, which he adjusted on
his nose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know me, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; he said, looking so intently at
Arabella that she began to feel alarmed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; she replied timidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the gentleman, nursing his left leg; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
how you should. You know my name though, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I?&rdquo; said Arabella, trembling, though she scarcely knew
why. &ldquo;May I ask you what it is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Presently, ma&rsquo;am, presently,&rdquo; said the stranger, not having
yet removed his eyes from her countenance. &ldquo;You have been
recently married, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; replied Arabella, in a scarcely audible tone, laying
aside her work, and becoming greatly agitated as a thought, that
had occurred to her before, struck more forcibly upon her mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without having represented to your husband the propriety of
first consulting his father, on whom he is dependent, I think?&rdquo;
said the stranger.</p>

<p>Arabella applied her handkerchief to her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without an endeavour, even, to ascertain, by some indirect
appeal, what were the old man&rsquo;s sentiments on a point in which he
would naturally feel much interested?&rdquo; said the stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot deny it, sir,&rdquo; said Arabella.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And without having sufficient property of your own to afford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
your husband any permanent assistance in exchange for the worldly
advantages which you knew he would have gained if he had married
agreeably to his father&rsquo;s wishes?&rdquo; said the old gentleman. &ldquo;This
is what boys and girls call disinterested affection, till they have boys
and girls of their own, and then they see it in a rougher and very
different light!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arabella&rsquo;s tears flowed fast, as she pleaded in extenuation that
she was young and inexperienced; that her attachment had alone
induced her to take the step to which she had resorted; and that
she had been deprived of the counsel and guidance of her parents
almost from infancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was wrong,&rdquo; said the old gentleman in a milder tone, &ldquo;very
wrong. It was foolish, romantic, unbusiness-like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was my fault; all my fault, sir,&rdquo; replied poor Arabella,
weeping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said the old gentleman; &ldquo;it was not your fault
that he fell in love with you, I suppose? Yes it was, though,&rdquo; said
the old gentleman, looking rather slyly at Arabella. &ldquo;It was your
fault. He couldn&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This little compliment, or the little gentleman&rsquo;s odd way of
paying it, or his altered manner&mdash;so much kinder than it was at
first&mdash;or all three together, forced a smile from Arabella in the
midst of her tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your husband?&rdquo; inquired the old gentleman
abruptly; stopping a smile which was just coming over his own
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I expect him every instant, sir,&rdquo; said Arabella. &ldquo;I persuaded
him to take a walk this morning. He is very low and wretched at
not having heard from his father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Low, is he?&rdquo; said the old gentleman. &ldquo;Serve him right!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He feels it on my account, I am afraid,&rdquo; said Arabella; &ldquo;and
indeed, sir, I feel it deeply on his. I have been the sole means of
bringing him to his present condition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind on his account, my dear,&rdquo; said the old gentleman.
&ldquo;It serves him right. I am glad of it&mdash;actually glad of it, as far
as he is concerned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words were scarcely out of the old gentleman&rsquo;s lips, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
footsteps were heard ascending the stairs, which he and Arabella
seemed both to recognise at the same moment. The little gentleman
turned pale, and making a strong effort to appear composed,
stood up, as Mr. Winkle entered the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; cried Mr. Winkle, recoiling in amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the little old gentleman. &ldquo;Well, sir, what
have you got to say to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Winkle remained silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are ashamed of yourself, I hope, sir?&rdquo; said the old
gentleman.</p>

<p>Still Mr. Winkle said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you ashamed of yourself, sir, or are you not?&rdquo; inquired
the old gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Winkle, drawing Arabella&rsquo;s arm through
his. &ldquo;I am not ashamed of myself, or of my wife either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my word!&rdquo; cried the old gentleman, ironically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry to have done anything which has lessened your
affection for me, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Winkle; &ldquo;but I will say, at the same
time, that I have no reason to be ashamed of having this lady for
my wife, nor you of having her for a daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me your hand, Nat,&rdquo; said the old gentleman in an altered
voice. &ldquo;Kiss me, my love. You <em>are</em> a very charming little
daughter-in-law after all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a few minutes&rsquo; time Mr. Winkle went in search of Mr. Pickwick,
and returning with that gentleman, presented him to his
father, whereupon they shook hands for five minutes incessantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pickwick, I thank you most heartily for all your kindness
to my son,&rdquo; said old Mr. Winkle, in a bluff straightforward way.
&ldquo;I am a hasty fellow, and when I saw you last, I was vexed and
taken by surprise. I have judged for myself now, and am more
than satisfied. Shall I make any more apologies, Mr. Pickwick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not one,&rdquo; replied that gentleman. &ldquo;You have done the only
thing wanting to complete my happiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hereupon, there was another shaking of hands for five minutes
longer, accompanied by a great number of complimentary speeches,
which, besides being complimentary, had the additional and very
novel recommendation of being sincere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span></p>

<p>Sam had dutifully seen his father to the Belle Sauvage, when, on
returning, he encountered the fat boy in the court, who had been
charged with the delivery of a note from Emily Wardle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; said Joe, who was unusually loquacious, &ldquo;what a pretty
girl Mary is, isn&rsquo;t she? I am <em>so</em> fond of her, I am!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Weller made no verbal remark in reply; but eyeing the fat
boy for a moment, quite transfixed at his presumption, led him by
the collar to the corner, and dismissed him with a harmless but
ceremonious kick. After which, he walked home, whistling.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">For</span> a whole week after the happy arrival of Mr.
Winkle from Birmingham, Mr. Pickwick and Sam
Weller were from home all day long, only returning
just in time for dinner, and then wearing
an air of mystery and importance quite foreign to
their natures. It was evident that very grave and
eventful proceedings were on foot; but various
surmises were afloat, respecting their precise
character. Some (among whom was Mr. Tupman) were disposed
to think that Mr. Pickwick contemplated a matrimonial alliance;
but this idea the ladies most strenuously repudiated. Others
rather inclined to the belief that he had projected some distant
tour, and was at present occupied in effecting the preliminary
arrangements; but this again was stoutly denied by Sam himself,
who had unequivocally stated when cross-examined by Mary that
no new journeys were to be undertaken. At length, when the brains
of the whole party had been racked for six long days, by unavailing
speculation, it was unanimously resolved that Mr. Pickwick should
be called upon to explain his conduct, and to state distinctly why he
had thus absented himself from the society of his admiring friends.</p>

<p>With this view, Mr. Wardle invited the full circle to dinner at
the Adelphi; and, the decanters having been twice sent round,
opened the business.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are all anxious to know,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, &ldquo;what
we have done to offend you, and to induce you to desert us and
devote yourself to these solitary walks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you?&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;It is singular enough that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
I had intended to volunteer a full explanation this very day; so, if
you will give me another glass of wine, I will satisfy your curiosity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The decanters passed from hand to hand with unwonted briskness,
and Mr. Pickwick, looking round on the faces of his friends
with a cheerful smile, proceeded:</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the changes that have taken place among us,&rdquo; said Mr.
Pickwick, &ldquo;I mean the marriage that <em>has</em> taken place, and the
marriage that <em>will</em> take place, with the changes they involve, rendered
it necessary for me to think, soberly and at once, upon my
future plans. I determined on retiring to some quiet, pretty neighbourhood
in the vicinity of London; I saw a house which exactly
suited my fancy; I have taken it and furnished it. It is fully
prepared for my reception, and I intend entering upon it at once,
trusting that I may yet live to spend many quiet years in peaceful
retirement, cheered through life by the society of my friends, and
followed in death by their affectionate remembrance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Mr. Pickwick paused, and a low murmur ran round the
table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The house I have taken,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;is at Dulwich.
It has a large garden, and is situated in one of the most pleasant
spots near London. It has been fitted up with every attention to
substantial comfort; perhaps to a little elegance besides; but of
that you shall judge for yourselves. Sam accompanies me there.
I have engaged, on Perker&rsquo;s representation, a housekeeper&mdash;a very
old one&mdash;and such other servants as she thinks I shall require. I
propose to consecrate this little retreat by having a ceremony, in
which I take a great interest, performed there. I wish, if my friend
Wardle entertains no objection, that his daughter should be married
from my new house, on the day I take possession of it. The
happiness of young people,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, a little moved, &ldquo;has
ever been the chief pleasure of my life. It will warm my heart to
witness the happiness of those friends who are dearest to me,
beneath my own roof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick paused again: Emily and Arabella sobbed audibly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have communicated, both personally and by letter, with the
Club,&rdquo; resumed Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;acquainting them with my intention.
During our long absence, it had suffered much from internal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
dissensions; and the withdrawal of my name, coupled with this and
other circumstances, has occasioned its dissolution. The Pickwick
Club exists no longer.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 404px;"><a id="ill18"></a>
<img src="images/ill18.png" width="404" height="335" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>&ldquo;The happiness of young people,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, a little moved,
&ldquo;has ever been the chief pleasure of my life&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;I shall never regret,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick in a low voice, &ldquo;I shall
never regret having devoted the greater part of two years to mixing
with different varieties and shades of human character: frivolous
as my pursuit of novelty may have appeared to many. Nearly the
whole of my previous life having been devoted to business and the
pursuit of wealth, numerous scenes of which I had no previous
conception have dawned upon me&mdash;I hope to the enlargement of
my mind, and the improvement of my understanding. If I have
done but little good, I trust I have done less harm, and that none
of my adventures will be other than a source of amusing and
pleasant recollection to me in the decline of life. God bless
you all!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span></p>

<p>With these words, Mr. Pickwick filled and drained a bumper
with a trembling hand, and his eyes moistened as his friends rose
with one accord and pledged him from their hearts.</p>

<p>There were very few preparatory arrangements to be made for
the marriage of Mr. Snodgrass. As he had neither father nor
mother, and had been in his minority a ward of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s,
that gentleman was perfectly well acquainted with his possessions
and prospects. His account of both was quite satisfactory to
Wardle&mdash;as almost any other account would have been, for the
good old gentleman was overflowing with hilarity and kindness&mdash;and
a handsome portion having been bestowed upon Emily, the
marriage was fixed to take place on the fourth day from that time;
the suddenness of which preparations reduced three dressmakers
and a tailor to the extreme verge of insanity.</p>

<p>Getting post-horses to the carriage, old Wardle started off
next day, to bring his mother up to town. Communicating his
intelligence to the old lady with characteristic impetuosity, she
instantly fainted away; but being promptly revived, ordered the
brocaded silk gown to be packed up forthwith, and proceeded to
relate some circumstances of a similar nature attending the marriage
of the eldest daughter of Lady Tollimglower, deceased, which
occupied three hours in the recital, and were not half finished
at last.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trundle had to be informed of all the mighty preparations
that were making in London, and being in a delicate state of
health was informed thereof through Mr. Trundle, lest the news
should be too much for her; but it was not too much for her,
inasmuch as she at once wrote off to Muggleton, to order a new
cap and a black satin gown, and moreover avowed her determination
of being present at the ceremony. Hereupon Mr. Trundle called
in the doctor, and the doctor said Mrs. Trundle ought to know
best how she felt herself, to which Mrs. Trundle replied that
she felt herself quite equal to it, and that she had made up her
mind to go; upon which the doctor, who was a wise and discreet
doctor, and knew what was good for himself as well as for other
people, said that perhaps if Mrs. Trundle stopped at home she
might hurt herself more by fretting, than by going, so perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
she had better go. And she did go; the doctor with great attention
sending in half a dozen of medicine, to be drunk upon the road.</p>

<p>In addition to these points of distraction, Wardle was entrusted
with two small letters to two small young ladies who were to act
as bridesmaids; upon the receipt of which, the two young ladies
were driven to despair by having no &ldquo;things&rdquo; ready for so important
an occasion, and no time to make them in&mdash;a circumstance
which appeared to afford the two worthy papas of the two small
young ladies rather a feeling of satisfaction than otherwise. However,
old frocks were trimmed, and new bonnets made, and the
young ladies looked as well as could possibly have been expected
of them. And as they cried at the subsequent ceremony in the
proper places, and trembled at the right times, they acquitted
themselves to the admiration of all beholders.</p>

<p>How the two poor relations ever reached London&mdash;whether
they walked, or got behind coaches, or procured lifts in waggons,
or carried each other by turns&mdash;is uncertain; but there they were,
before Wardle; and the very first people that knocked at the door
of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s house, on the bridal morning, were the two poor
relations, all smiles and shirt collar.</p>

<p>They were welcomed heartily though, for riches or poverty had
no influence on Mr. Pickwick; the new servants were all alacrity
and readiness; Sam was in a most unrivalled state of high spirits
and excitement; Mary was glowing with beauty and smart ribands.</p>

<p>The bridegroom, who had been staying at the house for two or
three days previous, sallied forth gallantly to Dulwich Church to
meet the bride, attended by Mr. Pickwick, Ben Allen, Bob Sawyer,
and Mr. Tupman; with Sam Weller outside, having at his button-hole
a white favour, the gift of his lady-love, and clad in a new
and gorgeous suit of livery invented for the occasion. They were
met by the Wardles, and the Winkles, and the bride and bridesmaids,
and the Trundles; and the ceremony having been performed,
the coaches rattled back to Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s to breakfast,
where little Mr. Perker already awaited them.</p>

<p>Here, all the light clouds of the more solemn part of the proceedings
passed away; every face shone forth joyously; nothing
was to be heard but congratulations and commendations. Everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
was so beautiful! The lawn in front, the garden behind,
the miniature conservatory, the dining-room, the drawing-room,
the bedrooms, the smoking-room, and above all the study, with
its pictures and easy chairs, and odd cabinets, and queer tables,
and books out of number, with a large cheerful window opening
upon a pleasant lawn and commanding a pretty landscape, dotted
here and there with little houses almost hidden by the trees; and
then the curtains, and the carpets, and the chairs, and the sofas!
Everything was so beautiful, so compact, so neat, and in such
exquisite taste, said everybody, that there really was no deciding
what to admire most.</p>

<p>And in the midst of all this, stood Mr. Pickwick, his countenance
lighted up with smiles, which the heart of no man, woman, or
child, could resist: himself the happiest of the group: shaking
hands over and over again with the same people, and when his
own hands were not so employed, rubbing them with pleasure;
turning round in a different direction at every fresh expression of
gratification or curiosity, and inspiring everybody with his looks of
gladness and delight.</p>

<p>Breakfast is announced. Mr. Pickwick leads the old lady (who
has been very eloquent on the subject of Lady Tollimglower) to
the top of a long table; Wardle takes the bottom; the friends
arrange themselves on either side; Sam takes his station behind his
master&rsquo;s chair; the laughter and talking cease; Mr. Pickwick,
having said grace, pauses for an instant, and looks round him.
As he does so, the tears roll down his cheeks, in the fulness of
his joy.</p>

<p>Let us leave our old friend in one of those moments of unmixed
happiness, of which, if we seek them, there are ever some, to cheer
our transitory existence here. There are dark shadows on the
earth, but its lights are stronger in the contrast. Some men, like
bats or owls, have better eyes for the darkness than for the light.
We, who have no such optical powers, are better pleased to take
our last parting look at the visionary companions of many solitary
hours, when the brief sunshine of the world is blazing full upon
them.</p>

<p>The admiration of numerous

<p>It is the fate of most men who mingle with the world, and attain
even the prime of life, to make many real friends, and lose them
in the course of nature. It is the fate of all authors or chroniclers
to create imaginary friends, and lose them in the course of art.
Nor is this the full extent of their misfortunes; for they are
required to furnish an account of them besides.</p>

<p>In compliance with this custom&mdash;unquestionably
a bad one&mdash;we subjoin a few
biographical words, in relation to the
party at Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s assembled.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Winkle, being fully received
into favour by the old gentleman,
were shortly afterwards installed in a
newly-built house, not half a mile from
Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s. Mr. Winkle, being engaged
in the City as agent or town correspondent
of his father, exchanged his
old costume for the ordinary dress of
Englishmen, and presented all the external
appearance of a civilised Christian
ever afterwards.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="jst">Exchanged his old costume

</div></div>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Snodgrass settled at
Dingley Dell, where they purchased and
cultivated a small farm, more for occupation
than profit. Mr. Snodgrass, being
occasionally abstracted and melancholy, is
to this day reputed a great poet among
his friends and acquaintance, although we
do not find that he has ever written anything to encourage the
belief. There are many celebrated characters, literary, philosophical,
and otherwise, who hold a high reputation on a similar tenure.</p>

<p>Mr. Tupman, when his friends married, and Mr. Pickwick
settled, took lodgings at Richmond, where he has ever since resided.
He walks constantly on the terrace during the summer months,
with a youthful and jaunty air which has rendered him the admiration
of the numerous elderly ladies of single condition, who reside
in the vicinity. He has never proposed again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Bob Sawyer, having previously passed through the <cite>Gazette</cite>,
passed over to Bengal, accompanied by Mr. Benjamin Allen; both
gentlemen having received surgical appointments from the East
India Company. They each had the yellow fever fourteen times,
and then resolved to try a little abstinence; since which period,
they have been doing well.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bardell let lodgings to many conversable single gentleman,
with great profit, but never brought any more actions for breach of
promise of marriage. Her attorneys, Messrs. Dodson and Fogg,
continue in business, from which they realise a large income, and
in which they are universally considered among the sharpest of
the sharp.</p>

<p>Sam Weller kept his word, and remained unmarried, for two
years. The old housekeeper dying at the end of that time, Mr.
Pickwick promoted Mary to the situation, on condition of her
marrying Mr. Weller at once, which she did without a murmur.
From the circumstance of two sturdy little boys having been
repeatedly seen at the gate of the back garden, there is reason to
suppose that Sam has some family.</p>

<p>The elder Mr. Weller drove a coach for twelve months, but,
being afflicted with the gout, was compelled to retire. The contents
of the pocket-book had been so well invested for him, however,
by Mr. Pickwick, that he had a handsome independence to
retire on, upon which he still lives at an excellent public-house
near Shooter&rsquo;s Hill, where he is quite reverenced as an oracle:
boasting very much of his intimacy with Mr. Pickwick, and retaining
a most unconquerable aversion to widows.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick himself continued to reside in his new house,
employing his leisure hours in arranging the memoranda which he
afterwards presented to the secretary of the once famous Club, or
in hearing Sam Weller read aloud, with such remarks as suggested
themselves to his mind, which never failed to afford Mr. Pickwick
great amusement. He was much troubled at first, by the numerous
applications made to him by Mr. Snodgrass, Mr. Winkle, and Mr.
Trundle, to act as godfather to their offspring; but he has become
used to it now, and officiates as a matter of course. He never had
occasion to regret his bounty to Mr. Jingle; for both that person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
and Job Trotter became, in time, worthy members of society,
although they have always steadily objected to return to the scenes
of their old haunts and temptations. Mr. Pickwick is somewhat
infirm now; but he retains all his former juvenility of spirit, and
may still be frequently seen contemplating the pictures in the
Dulwich Gallery, or enjoying a walk about the pleasant neighbourhood
on a fine day. He is known by all the poor people about,
who never fail to take their hats off, as he passes, with great respect.
The children idolise him, and so indeed does the whole neighbourhood.
Every year he repairs to a large family merry-making at
Mr. Wardle&rsquo;s; on this, as on all other occasions, he is invariably
attended by the faithful Sam, between whom and his master there
exists a steady and reciprocal attachment which nothing but death
will terminate.</p>
